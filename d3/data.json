Their goal was to get Trump elected and they are doing their job. I'm mad at the fucking Democrats. You know why?\n\n> Because [every1](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-donald/) [single2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) [fucking3](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/why-does-sanders-do-better-clinton-against-trump) [poll4](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-sanders) showed Clinton neck and neck with trump and Bernie out way ahead. Clinton isn't losing because she's a democrat, she's losing because a lot of her actions have been dishonest and people don't trust her. \n\n> That's where Sanders has the big advantage. Even many Clinton supporters admit that they don't like her but they are only voting for her because they like Trump less. What a glowing endorsement. That's why Bernie was a better candidate but the Democrats had to have their queen and now they reap what they sow. Now I know many people will argue that since Clinton > Sanders and Trump > Clinton that means that Trump > Sanders. This is incorrect thinking for a number of reasons. \n\n> Clinton was able to win the primary because she controlled the liberal leaning media and because the Democratic party worked against Bernie Sanders during the primary. \n\n> CNN, MSNBC, NY Times and many liberal comedic pundits were very much biased towards her. This can have a profound impact on a race and drive many supporters away from Sanders to Clinton (even if they didn't like her).\n\n> CNN was mocked as the Clinton News Network because of how biased they were against Sanders and many \"comedic\" pundits like Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers, and others were quick to bash Bernie and his supporters while ignoring the flaws in Clinton. Bernie Bros spread like wildfire even though the Bernie camp had more women in it than the Clinton camp. Clinton also adopted similar language to what Bernie Sanders was saying in order to woo Bernie supporters away from him. So, while they didn't rig the electoral ballot, they sure put all their effort into crushing Bernie's movement instead of trying to understand why Bernie was getting so much support. After he lost Clinton went back to business as usual and Trump catered to Bernie's supporters and tried to woo them.\n\n\n> But wait, if it's true that Clinton controlled so many media outlets and tv shows then why is she losing (maybe did lose depending on time of reading)? By your logic, she should be crushing Trump. Here, lies the biggest flaw in the Democrats plan. They could influence many liberal leaning networks to show Clinton favoritism but Republicans don't watch those shows. A hard core Republican doesn't care about what Samantha Bee has to say. They don't care about MSNBC. So that magical lead that Clinton could force over Sanders (barely) wasn't there against Trump. And the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party worked so hard to trivialize Sanders' supporters ended up biting them in the ass as many did not want to come out and support her. You want to mock and trivialize me so much? Fine, now you get your wish, I am non-existent in this race. \n\n> To put it simply, the Democrats misread the situation and didn't realize the anger boiling up against the establishment. The second they won the primary they shifted tactics to wooing Republicans rather than sticking to Sanders' message because it never occurred to them that Sanders' supporters wouldn't want Hillary. They assumed that Sanders' supporters would just fall in line (like in races before).\n\n\n> So, yeah, Fuck CNN, Fuck the Democrats, and Fuck the new wave of shitty late night comedic pundits. They are cancerous fucks who did everything they could to push out a populist candidate and elect their hated candidate. They deserve what they got.\n\n\n> P.S. Everyone who thinks that this race was decided by Comey's letter about the email investigation being reopened is probably wrong. That was released too close the election time to sink in. Most Republicans will feel vindicated (but they're not voting for Hillary anyway) while most Democrats will feel distrustful of the letter. He released it right next to the election time. This is probably a setup to crush Hillary. I won't fall for it. So, yeah, I doubt it had much effect on the election but it will most likely still be a scapegoat for the loss (instead of researching the real reasons).\n\nEDIT: Link to where I saw it from: \n",

But it's so much more than simply being a problem with other people being idiots, and ourselves being blameless. Both parties and even the \"Corporate Media\" we always hear so much about have severely underestimated the anger and resentment Americans feel right now. This is not about any specific problems, but at the idea of events like, for example, a Democratic Party deciding people will fall in line and vote for their candidate simply because they're not as bad as \"that guy\", or that the Republican Party would continuously try to drop taxes on the wealthy and block social reforms Americans seem to feel strongly about, among other, possibly more egregious transgressions by both sides.\n\nThis election isn't about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This election has been about which party tapped into that anger better. The Democrats had a candidate that people felt understood their anger, and the Republicans eventually were pushed into nominating theirs, but the forces acting upon both parties are no different. For just a second, forget the platforms that are, in fact, more important than anything else. Don't forget that the Republicans had to be strong-armed into nominating Donald, just as the Democrats fought against nominating Bernie. On both sides, people are fighting to change the status quo and fighting to keep it. People feel they have been played as pawns; Therefore, they wish to provide the checkmate. If you are wondering how this possibly could have happened, it's because in the course of history the wrath of the people will always be answered, whether it be peacefully, militarily, culturally, or in some other way. This wrath has been created through a underestimating of the people, a dismissal of them, a belief that they can be controlled and will follow like a puppy to its master. We can only hope the wrath is answered favorably.",

Isn't it a problem when your president runs on a platform that seems impossible to implement?\n\nSecond, and more seriously, is Trump still planning to deport ~12 million people? Is the plan for that still deportation squads? \n\nThird, has Trump said whether his plan for ISIS involves missiles, or boots on the ground, or anything like that? I've only heard \"we're going to take them out and then get out\". Which leads me to:\n\nFourth, does Trump plan to do ANYTHING in terms of the stability of Iraq, and how does he feel about Assad and the situation in Syria in general? \n\nLastly, has Trump refined his view on global warming so that it's no longer a Chinese hoax? Or is he still going on with that stuff? Like, even if you're the type to not think that global warming is caused by man, that's at least more understandable than saying it was all a ruse made up by the Chinese...",

This, to me, signifies that the impact of those words has decreased significantly, that they are losing their power completely. I don't welcome that. It's a change brought about by those words being abused to the point of meaninglessness. Somewhere along the line, it was discovered that those words have power over others, that they can be used to make empathetic individuals do what you want, in order to avoid being labeled with them.\n\nTrump is a result of that abuse. His campaign only grew stronger as people started throwing slurs at him and his followers. Instead of engaging them, and explaining one's position to them, many simply chose to yell incoherently at them, to cry wolf as it has been done for so long now. And I know that there are many who will say that those people don't deserve to be treated with kindness and debated with. That they're bigots and their minds won't change, and blah blah blah. What those people don't realise is that their mindset is exactly why Trump is president now. And until it changes, until people are capable of starting a dialogue instead of spouting rhetoric and slurs, the sentiment that caused him to win this election will linger and grow stronger.\n\nSo I hope, for all of our sakes, that this particular brand of zealotry will soon end.",

And it's going be fucking this.\n\nYes, we just put a man in charge of the Executive Branch of our government as well as acting President of our country. An absolutely deranged and demented man, but nonetheless he is now in power. And with that, a conservative republican Senate and House of Representatives. \n\nBut Americans of reddit, this is not the time to kick ourselves in the ass and call it a day for this election cycle. The hate, anger, regret, or downright just blind rage any of you must be feeling will be there, but we **must** take it and turn it into passion. In the next four years, we will have chances to now take a critical eye to our Legislative Branch and vote with a much clearer head. \n\nWe've gotten so caught up with the need to choose one side or the other that we've mixed out branches of government up, thinking that one man or woman in a seat somewhere on the east coast can suddenly change decades of laws that have been passed by the many people of the United States Congress and House of Representatives. So now, open up a tab and start looking into the names of your new or re-elected senators. Form opinions of them, keep an eye on who will have a campaign going when the seasons starts up.\n\nAnd for christ's sake, people, **FUCKING VOTE.** IN EVERYTHING. Not just one election that happens every FOUR YEARS. Vote for your school boards, vote for your mayors, vote for whether or not you want red, green, or blue. JUST VOTE. Because those smaller votes, and the people you put in power, will begin to shape the higher tiers of government. You think Trump will ban gay marriage? That's up to the senate. Our school funding? Senate. Who's going to war? Senate. Toilet paper topside or bottom? SENATE. \n\nSo yea, rage against the dying light and all that business. And do it with a clear, informed mind and steady hand.

Let's be honest here: there were, without doubt, better candidates for both parties during the primaries, but we ended up with Trump and Clinton - why? Money and corruption - that's why. Everyone who is angry about this election should be directing that anger at the Electoral College, the CPD, the RNC and the DNC. I woke up this morning saddened by the news, but not so much because Trump won. I was sad because, even in arguably the most divisive presidential campaign in history, with arguably the two most disliked presidential candidates in history, the American people didn't even have the balls to give 5% of their vote to a third party so that they could secure federal funding and all the other perks of being recognized as minor party and maybe, *maybe* have a chance of effecting meaningful change in the future. I even witnessed some people lashing out in anger at those who voted third party, blaming them for their candidate's loss - literally supporting the system that gave them such terrible choices. That's not democracy, that's Stockholm syndrome.",

Sorry to keep you waiting. Thank you very much. I've just recieved a call from Sec. CLinton. She congratulated us...us on our victory and I congratulated her and her family. .... Now it is time for America to get together to heal the wounds that divide this nation\n\n>President-Elect Trump: I pledge to every citizen of this land that i will be a president for all the people. I am reaching out to those who have not supported me to work together.\n\n>President-Elect Trump: The government will serve the people. Working together we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding the nation.\n\n\n>President-Elect Trump: They have called this a historic event but for this to be historic we have to do a good job and we will do a good job. Maybe after 2,3,4 or even 8 years we can say we did a good job.\n\n\n\nSo, if he's serious, and since this is obviously now our reality, why don't we as citizens and as people who did not vote for him, write to him? Remind him of these words, and ask him to prove them. Ask him to promote equality for EVERYONE in this country, women, LGBTQ, people of other races and cultures? To promote not only the equality of these people, but to promote their safety and to work to heal their fear of discrimination and even of violence against them. Ask him to truly lead, and show those of us that didn't vote for him that he IS capable of doing a \"good job\"?  At this time, I think taking that kind of action would be far more effective than all the hate and sadness and disbelief we can throw around in social media. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

But bear with me.\n\nThis morning, after I put my kid on the bus for school, I put out the trash and recyclables. It's what happens every Wednesday. I got a glorious view of the sun rising in the east. You could hear the ducks calling off in the distance, and it's cool but comfortable. A perfect fall morning if you like to be outside. And that's when thing really started to hit home. The sun is still coming up. Life still goes on pretty much as normal. \n\nThings, in terms of the vote, didn't go the way many of us expected. A lot of us want to blame the other side. A lot of us want to focus only on the campaign run by the folks who won. Maybe, we need to take a minute and look at who we put up in this fight. For some of us who voted for Hillary (like me), it was a vote simply because it was the only other logical choice. This was by all accounts a lesser of two evils election. But both sides had the same issues. Both were divisive. Both had their skeletons in the closet. Both had their ideas that made you wonder what they had been smoking.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not happy with the outcome of this thing. Many expletive laden tirades were spoken last night as returns came in on my couch last night. I don't like Trump in the least, and I have less love for Pence. But instead of just grousing about the outcome and focusing on the GOP, it's time for the Democrats to look at themselves, and examine why we were so soundly rejected. In the end, I think if you really dig down, we offered more of the same. Trump was right that Hillary would just be Obama v.2. While from some people's view that would be a great thing, some people were tired of him.\n\nLook back to the previous elections. Bush the eldest lost because they thought it'd be more of the same. Gore lost because they thought he'd be Clinton all over again. Kerry lost because Obama offered the hope of change. And so it is again here. Some people were fed up with how things were going, and wanted a change. And the Democrats offered more of the same. They didn't loose to Trump. They lost because they offered up a candidate that was more of the same. And I say this as someone who voted for her.\n\nIn the end, the world is still spinning. The sun still rises. I'll go to work this afternoon. Nothing is going to majorly change right this second. And while I do not like the person elected, and I do not like his policies, it appears right now that he won fair and square. So while I do not stand for what he believes in, he's the president-elect. I do not wish him ill, and as odd as it sounds, I wish him well. It's the American thing to do: honor the transfer of power according to the will of the people. \n\nWhat we need to do on the left side of the aisle, over the next 4 years, is take a deep, long look at this election. It's apparent that we're out of touch with America, and you can see it in how soundly we were rejected. Time to retool, rearm, and be ready for 2020.",

Here is the issue. Donald Trump on his own may not be dangerous, but the people who support him, who have been empowered by him going into office, are dangerous. Groups like the KKK and other white nationalist groups feel like they have a voice in this society again. As a person of colour, I'm scared, not because I think Trump is going to do anything to me, but because I think that I'm going to face discrimination from those people, and they won't be afraid to do something because they think that it's ok and it's acceptable. Mike Pence, Trump's VP, a homophobe who believes in conversion therapy, gives voice to the people who want to commit hateful acts towards and take away rights from the LGBT community. They just earned the right to be married, and we're still not a country where they're accepted fully, so you can understand why they would be afraid. Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric gives power to the bible thumpers, and to racists, who are going to commit acts of violence against Muslims, because just like the earlier example, they think that it is acceptable.\n\nIf you're a Trump supporter, I understand why you're happy. You did what you said you would do, you have toppled the system. No matter what, both the Republican and Democratic party has been changed, they can't stay the way they're. At the same time, show compassion to your countrymen and countrywomen who are afraid and angry. Earlier today, I unfairly grouped all Trump supporters as racists, sexists, etc. I was wrong. I understand that the majority of you're not like that. You're the same as me or any other person in this country. At the end of the day, we want what is best for ourselves and our country. No matter what, we have to live in this country. So, let's come together, let's try not to go backwards, but take a step forward. Let's make sure that NOBODY feels persecuted, nobody is discriminated against, and that nobody is excluded. United we stand, divided we fall is the biggest cliche there is, but it is applicable here. I don't like Trump, I don't agree with any of his views, but he won, and I have to accept that and we all have to work together to make sure that our country stays number one.  \n",
