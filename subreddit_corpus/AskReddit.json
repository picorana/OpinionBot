We got married 6 months into the relationship and that first year of marriage nearly broke me. He was constantly lying and there was always money missing, he said he had a job but no income was coming in. Found out at the end of the year that he had a gambling addiction. $20 here would turn into $200 into the poker machine within minutes. I had never seen this side to him ever in all our years of talking. Starting blaming myself that I could jump into having a kid with a stranger. He kept lying about his job, his whereabouts and would sometimes come home with big bundles of cash that would immediately disappear again. I generally believed that this guy loved me and yet he here he was making my life hell. It has taken nearly 3 years of building our relationship again with him but yes there was a time I did fall out of love. Took a lot of patience, forgiveness, trust, love and respect but he is a great father and is on track to making everything right again.\n\nSorry for the long post I started venting.

I said. \n \n'She will grow them soon, we can speed it up by tossing her between us until she flies.' Then they told me I had to get out of bed because I wasn't a fairy. I told them I couldn't because I had a broken leg. They insisted, that I get out of bed. I said, 'I'll tell the nurses.'  and they said, 'The nurses can't see us, they are muggles.'

            "\"I was locked in my bathroom all day.\"  \n  \nThe knob fell off my bathroom door - if you've never seen a knobless door, there's a bit of metal inside the door with a square hole in it. A small metal bar goes through that hole and you affix the knob to each end of the bar. Turning the knob turns the bar, which turns the metal bit inside the door which lets you pull the door. Or if you pull too hard, you rip the knob off the bar or rip the metal out of the door.  \n  \nAnyway, enough teaching. Without a knob I was using the metal bar to turn the door, which is quite a difficult thing to do to begin with because you have very little leverage. One day my hands were still slippery from the shower and I accidentally pushed the bar through the hole and it fell out the other side of the door. There was no similarly shaped & sized object to put in the door or any other way of opening it, so I was stuck in there for ~15 hours, naked.  \n  \nFinally got out by soaking a flanel in soap and slipping it through the hole, when the flanel was drying I lathered some random ex's gel on it and it hardened just enough for me to turn the door. I genuinely worried I was gonna starve to death in my bathroom for a while though."

So, since he was an accountant/some financial guru of some type, and I had mentionned I was pretty broke in college, he offered to pay me $60 to help him with his online dating profile to get it more exposure. After a confused \"Are you actually serious\", I reluctantly agreed. Being only twenty-something myself and looking for my own relationship, I had no idea what value or expertise I could offer someone three times my own age.\n\nWe ate lunch at the small cafe right outside my school, and just spent the whole time talking. He was very bald, had beady little eyes, and was overall very quiet and mousey as a person. His profile, which I had looked over, was very artsy and punny, but didn't have a whole lot about him. So, I spent the whole time, not sure how long it was but it was over ten minutes, just trying to get him to talk about *himself*. I hit him with a question like \"Okay, suppose you're speed dating and you have thirty seconds for someone to get to know you. *GO*.\" He froze up, started asking if that's how speed dating really worked, and just avoided answering it with anything substantial. The meeting ended inconclusively, but he still gave me sixty bucks cash, and we continued chatting online afterwards, though a bit more infrequently. I think he did message me at one point just to say that he found someone, but I never followed up in any great detail.\n\nHe found my personal vent blog at one point, which was weird, and also bought a couple odds and ends off of my Etsy store (Anything green that I listed, because he liked green), but other than that it was never a friendship or anything, just awkward acquaintances. Apart from being socially stunted, to his credit he was never inappropriate with me or in any conversations we had had. I lost contact with him years ago when I switched e-mail addresses and Xanga later shut down any blog that wasn't part of their Wordpress kickstarter. So, that's that."

My mouth was gaping in pure awe the whole time.\n\nThe stronger dose was less enjoyable, when it started I could already tell this was going to be weird. I had severe open eye hallucinations, I remember seeing an abstract symbol floating in the air, and then instantly, as if to taunt me with its total lack of regard for physics and causality, it suddenly teleported to the opposite side of my field of view, now upside down for some reason. My senses began to fall apart after that, it was just a jumbled mess, static noise. I don't remember much of it. But when the song was over it turned scary, because I was used to sobering up by then, but not this time. So I became convinced the trip was never going to end and I had broken my brain. Eventually I came down, but I had some problems with general anxiety for a few months after that. I don't think I will take that large of a dose again.\n"

            "I was never THE bully or the Regina George but I have been the Gretchen Wieners before.\n\nSo it was the 3rd grade. I grew up in a wealthy suburb where the average family was considered upper middle class to downright wealthy. Like 80% white, 10% Asian, 10% everyone else.\n\nThis one girl, lets call her Regina, was the smartest girl in the class because she won all the awards. We were both ethnically Chinese and growing up in the US so we were friends.\n\nSo Regina didn't like another girl. Lets call her Hermione, because Hermione was a kiss-ass who would go up to adults, shake their hands, and say very quickly, \"Hello Mr./Mrs. _____, it is a pleasure to meet you! My name is Hermione!\" And the adults would be enamored by her while the fellow kids would scoff at how try-hard she was. She also had a tendency to say weird thing, like if someone pointed out it was raining she would add \"It's raining cats and dogs!\"\n\nSo I was part of Regina's posse and we would climb on top of the pull up bars because we were the more athletic girls. You could balance on top of it like you are sitting side-straddle on a broomstick, if you hook your ankle around the pole. We would sit there to show dominance.\n\nAnyway, Regina would talk so much smack about Hermione, and they would share stories with each other about how Hermione cried easily. I wanted to fit in so I made up some story about Hermione crying before I had even met her. Later Hermione and I got along okay, but I remembered my whole 5th grade class pranking her during a Revolutionary War simulation game where you could spend points to make an opponent lose more than you, and a couple kids on the Patriots side got together and \"bombed\" her until she lost half her points in one go. She cried and I said \"nobody likes Hermione\" while everyone was laughing. The teacher heard me and sent me to the principal's office for that comment and I cried because I wasn't one of the kids who bombed her so I thought what I said wasn't that bad.\n\nAnyway, now Hermione is a mezzo-soprano opera singer (not famous or anything, just regional opera houses I think) and Regina George designed an app that got featured on the New York Times. I work at a peon desk job in IT."

Really just felt like I'd be happier trying my hand at the art thing, and at least went into it knowing it was a stupid financial decision. Ten years later... we'll, I'm glad I did it but it's one thing as a 20 year old to know abstractly that it's hard, thankless, poverty inducing work and another to live those consequences. I'm still generally happy with my life path but I do fantasize about the other way it could've gone occasionally. But I think I would've spent more time wishing I was an artist if I went into science. It was always the concepts that I liked more in science anyway, which I can still keep up on.

            "I realized that my mother never payed attention to what I put in the shopping cart.  All she cared about was making me get the stuff on her list and having me do all of the work.  One day I tried something ballsy and grabbed a can of Foster's beer and hid it under other stuff.  As I was unloading the cart onto the belt at checkout I put her box of wine up first (overrides the need to keep checking ID) and then distracted her with a magazine or something if she wasn't busy buried in her checkbook when the beer came up to scan.  I did it a few more times, but usually never had to since I had older buddies anyways.  \n\nBefore anybody starts up a shit storm, she always put herself first.  I'd go hungry a lot of times if it meant she got her box of wine.  She had stolen plenty from me in the way of inheritance and cash gifts when I was a kid.  Her go-to explanation (lie) was \"I'm gonna take half and put it in your savings account\".  I never felt bad getting a few bottles.of booze on her dime when I got older."

My parents left to their beach house over the weekend, leaving me to look after the house alone. They absolutely forbid me from any type of intimate relationship of any sort, so I thought this would be the ultimate opportunity to have my gf come around. We got stuck straight into it straight away, using protection. Everything was perfect, however, when I went to have a shower my dog ran into my room and ate all of the used condoms off my floor. Yesterday my dog was shitting the little balloons all over the backyard, so to keep the secret from my parents I used a shovel to throw them over the fence. Right now my neighbour is at the door talking to dad while holding a plastic bag."

The medium doses were fun, I just saw quite vivid hallucinations in perfect synchronicity with the music I was listening to. It was basically like the best light show you could ever imagine. My mouth was gaping in pure awe the whole time.\n\nThe stronger dose was less enjoyable, when it started I could already tell this was going to be weird. I had severe open eye hallucinations, I remember seeing an abstract symbol floating in the air, and then instantly, as if to taunt me with its total lack of regard for physics and causality, it suddenly teleported to the opposite side of my field of view, now upside down for some reason. My senses began to fall apart after that, it was just a jumbled mess, static noise. I don't remember much of it. But when the song was over it turned scary, because I was used to sobering up by then, but not this time. So I became convinced the trip was never going to end and I had broken my brain. Eventually I came down, but I had some problems with general anxiety for a few months after that. I don't think I will take that large of a dose again."
