Much like the rerelease of the Sega Master System in Brazil.\n\nI was in Chile a few years ago - was having trouble with Spanish, so I went to a games store looking for a copy of Pokemon (or something with simple reading) for my DS. The games store only had bootlegging carts (the R4, etc.) and no real carts. \n\nMy guess is that Nintendo will want to turn that market into a paying market. To do that, they'll need to slowly convert everyone to real nintendo hardware and all the nostalgia that goes with it. A product like the NES classic can help do that, as it's cheap and official. Why bootleg when the real thing is so cheap.\n\nAnyway, I suspect that the nostalgia market in North America is actually a smaller slice of the real strategy here.",

Same thing on my android phone, many apps that emulate just by using that search word in the app store. \n\nIt sounds like effort to people who maybe never tried or looked I think when you use language they're unfamiliar with, but much easier than I thought originally! \n\nWith that said, I myself would probably still want to buy this new nes for nostalgia's sake and as you mentioned, people do like things out of the box already done for them.

How many times have games been outright broken because critical elements of *completed* games were excised before release? How many games require day-one patches because they're so incomplete? How many times have there been content on game disks locked behind pay-walls? Also, how many times have \"game of the year\" versions of games been released later... with all DLC included anyway? Profits on top of profits on top of profits. \n\nCorporate greed is ruining the once-great medium of video games -- and I could see the writing on the wall back in 2006 when I read about $2.50 horse armor. NES games from 30 years ago have more precedent than deluxe games released today. It isn't even like you can play your current generation favorite game into the future since a huge majority of current systems, and game titles, require online-drm/ network connectivity to work: Unlike retro systems.\n\nAs of right now the only video game system I have is the PS2. Hey... at least when I buy [Digital Devil Saga Vol. 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei:_Digital_Devil_Saga), I have the entire game on disk without DRM interfering my ability to play the title, and no content locked behind DLC on-disk pay-walls to experience the entire story, or game-play elements.\n\nI feel the reason the NES Classic is apparently doing so well is, yes, due to nostalgia, but in addition to that people are acquiring a good batch of *completed* games for a fair price. (It is also my opinion the NES Classic could have many more titles installed... why only 30 games, Nintendo?)",

Imagine for a moment they had different models with marginally different production costs, but sold them for price points from 60 up through 300.

With this much scarcity they could have captured significantly more surplus by having different price points. \n\nI'm not saying they should have. Just that I probably would have paid double yesterday for one. I was #24 in line at a store with 23 in stock. I went to two more locations, then ended up just disappointed. ",

I tried at midnight but the server kept timing out and eventually it got removed from my cart because it said it was out of stock. But then, surprise, I got another text alert at noon yesterday for gamestop. I immediately jumped on. It took me a full 25 minutes just to get through the checkout process, because their servers kept crashing, and rebooting. I kept having to refresh blank pages and the checkout process was four pages long. I'm surprised I didn't get charged a dozen times for the thing. Eventually I got a confirmation screen. Woohoo! Yesterday was my anniversary and my husband was super excited because that was his gift :)",

The appeal of this for many is that nostalgia but that ties to games and if they didn't include your game your shit out of luck. Going the emulator route is probably much better. \nHolding out hope that since this is just system on a chip someone hacks this and sells the chip with all the games on it. ",

They had their chance to redeem themselves with this thing - an absolutely trivial little device to manufacture - and they blew it. If they can't produce this, than they *definitely* cannot manufacture the Switch. Don't get me wrong. I absolutely love Nintendo. But don't understand why they just can't get their act together.\n\nIf they want to pull in more customers, they need to make their products available to the casual gamer. Right now, the only people with NES Classics are die hard Nintendo fans. That's it. Nobody else is willing to go through the effort to get one. To pull in the casual gamer, these things need to be an impulse item on an endcap.",

I see the strategy but for an item like this I think it's the wrong approach.  They may also do that for BF or early Dec, flood the market, but Nintendo has a history of being stingy. ",

The only caveat is that you need either a coax or RCA connection to the TV depending on which model you get.  Interesting tidbit is that the zapper will only work on older tube televisions.  My understanding is that it is due to the analog connection and predictable latency.  They may have fixed this in the NES classic since it has HDMI.",

            "body": "My buddy Justin was able to get one the night they came out and I played it. I mean, I'm an emulator guy so I just see a raspberry pi, an emulator, and an officially licensed curated 30 game collection of roms with a super kickass mini-NES scaled-down external case with the same springy buttons, the controller is the size of the little Nintendo itself, though oddly my buddy and I both found the length of the controller cord to be astonishingly short at about 2 1/2 ft (I could be off), and it only comes with ONE controller, the manual is printed in three languages and on the back of it is the original Nintendo Entertainment System poster. Gameplay was good though as well as it's user-friendlyness, but Nintendo always seems to do a decent job in that regard. My friend is primarily a console gamer, and I am primarily a PC gamer (though I use controllers for some games, Steam/X360 etc). And yet, with that one controller that comes with the mini-NES, we still had some great fun! We both switched off playing a few games over a few brews while watching some video mixtapes in the background on his projection screen (mainly SMASH TV's Megaplex, Skinemax, Memorex, WATCH&ENJOY THEM) so it was quite a fun night, think I got home around 4am, though we had a streak of pausing games and watching funny videos, and laughing and catching up. He has been a friend of mine since we were little little kids, we met at Sunday school in fact by pretending to put the baby dolls in the ovens and eat them, it was a mutually twisted nonchalant humor that would make us life long friends. And so something like this is always a fun excuse for me to come over at he and his wife's place after maybe an extended period of time since we got to hang out and catch up etc. Anyway life story aside, I'm really interested to see how these will be handled by Nintendo in regards to the supply and demand, I see it being a HOT Christmas and Holiday Season ITEM, but I guess each store only got 6 of them and that was it, which is why some of them are fetching like $2,500 on ebay and such. And the games they selected are I think ideal, you know I have various emulators on my computer, like \"900 NES roms = like 300 megabytes total!\" so it's incredible just how far information technology and digital data storage has come along since 1985. To beyond the infinite!",

Then remind yourself that some of them are fucking 30 years old. They might be quality games considering their age, but really, that should have little to no bearing on their pricetag in this day and age. Furhtermore, you can't add new games to it digitally, which is a fucking joke considering the storage these games require (which is like, what, 1kb each?). Yes, I realize that the reason for this has got to be about licensing, but as a customer I'm really not interested in the reasons for why they fail to provide a service as basic as this, I just want it to be there. Then you also have the problem of it only supporting a 1080p resolution, on a time where 4k is really starting to hit it big. Also, it contains no online capabilities whatsoever. Oh, and you have to buy a power adapter yourself.\n\nAll of this for roughly 80 fucking dollars? No thank you.",

Does not take long to get used to using a keyboard given all you need is 4 direction keys and 2 action keys.  So if you were suddenly super interested and now you see people trying to get several thousand dollars for them on ebay you might start looking around and discover the emulators.  Lets be real here, this will not replace the PS4 or XB1.  There are many DIY tutorials on how to make an emulator using a raspberry pi and other very cheap devices.  The games are only a few hundred KB each.  ",

Years ago, yeah, production was slower so they only had limited amounts of systems of copies of games. Today, we live in a day and age where that is unacceptable.\n\nIt excites me because I also do miss having it this way. I remember going every week to Gamestop for 3 weeks trying to get a copy of Black Ops. It made me appreciate the game even more when I got it. It's nostalgic. \n\nSo, I don't know if they were attempting to make demand VERY HIGH or if they done goofed. ",

Yes, you could go through a list of 700 \"games\", but 80 % of the games where essentially hacks and mockups of the existing games such as 2 x speed, 10 x scoring etc. etc.\n\nNonetheless you got a 30-50 fun games in a cartridge that played EXACTLY like the original, they where probably pirate copies burned onto a ROM cartridge and slightly modified.\n\nThis has been going on for years, I remember the last model I bought at one of those Arab-stores where you can get everything from a moske that prays in the morning (you know, that gift you give someone you truly hate, lol...sorry just joking), to that \"Super-computer-extra-oridinaire-special-price-for-you\" keyboard that comes complete with Nintendo games built right in. You plug the KEYBOARD which is operated by a bunch of batteries - right into your TV RF input (antenna) and play just like the ordinary NES.\n\nNow...20-30 years later Nintendo thinks...hm...maybe we should do this too? \n\nBetter late than never, huh? At least now you can own one with a good conscience. \n",

The first person other than us came at 3 AM and then a brother/sister combo at around 4. However, it was all worth it when, come morning, there were more than 50 people in line. To be fair our store was one of the luckier ones that got more than 35 units but my friends and I all managed to get one. :)",

I arrived there on Friday at 8:30 AM and the line was very short at about a dozen people.  So, I decided to grab some coffee and when I returned around 8:55 AM, the line had grown to about 50 people.  Nonetheless, the wait was short.  Nintendo World operated very efficiently.  They only allowed people in that line to enter the store and that line directed people to 3 cashiers dispatching Minis.  As soon as you got what you wanted, you were directed to the door.  I returned later in the day, around 6 PM, to see if they ran out.  Nope.  Instead, I found a line from Rockefeller Plaza stretching all the way to 6th Avenue.  I asked the people in the back if this was the line for the Nintendo Minis.  The response was, \"Sadly, yes!\"  As a joke, I started walking away and I called out \"Oh fuck this!  You people are nuts!  I'll just use Amazon!\"  They called back in unison, \"Amazon is sold out!\"  Then, I heard a few others, \"So is Best Buy and GameStop!\"  I wonder if Nintendo World ran out at this point.\n\nEdit: According to the Nintendo World NYC Facebook page, they sold out Saturday night.  They had a midnight launch party (the midnight between Thursday and Friday) where they sold an initial batch.  Then they closed and reopened on Friday at 9 AM.  They were selling endlessly between Friday 9 AM to Friday 9 PM.  Then they repeated that all day Saturday until they ran out.  They must have stocked thousands of units in that store and they moved them as fast as possible.",
