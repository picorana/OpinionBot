I preferred that so much over the Justice League being the one that comes in to help. \n\nThe Batman history movie montage bit was wonderful. \n\nYou can tell that the creators behind this flick also grabbed some tremendous comedy talent. All the villains were mostly fantastic comedians which totally helped. ",

This movie's background minifigures had realistic skin tones, while everyone in The Lego Movie (besides licensed characters) had traditional yellow Lego skin.

There are connections between the movies, but each can be its own self-contained thing. I don't see a real need for there to be a real canon between the movies.\n\nAt least, that's sorta how I would play with toys as a kid.

If they wanted to, they could have games and movies that use both Marvel and DC characters, but when it came to LEGO Dimensions, they decided it was best to include Disney in their decisions since Disney has (had) a competing game, and they considered giving them the go-ahead on Marvel characters but decided against it. I imagine that set a precedent so that LEGO shelves Marvel characters for movies and games, but that can't last forever. Once both of these houses play out their respective franchises a bit more, I'll bet we get a LEGO Marvel vs DC movie/game. ",

I went to AOL Build for a panel for The LEGO Batman Movie with Will Arnett and director Chris McKay.\nI had the opportunity to ask them a question about the movie (particularly how they got away with the IRON MAN SUCKS! joke) I got a picture with [McKay inside](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16508068_1558790167495123_3774636442248040223_n.jpg?oh=26ab1347bcc547c19da68cd79b4c59f6&oe=5906F252) and [Arnett right outside](https://scontent-iad3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/16649434_1558794910827982_5900499504045349335_n.jpg?oh=28a3f8bd0d5d3bb629e864c657a2acd3&oe=590951A6).\n\nLater that evening I attended an IMAX screening through a contest I won through the IMAX FB page. Somehow it was a premiere. On my way to the bathroom, I ran back into McKay who remembered me from earlier. After the film was done, I got a chance to wish him luck on the sequel and 100% prepared for every LEGO Movie Warner Bros. is ready to throw at me.\n\nHe thanked me, and then gave me very secret information that might blow your ****ing mind.\n\nHe wants to do a LEGO Justice League Movie.",

Loved all the jabs at the various incarnations of Batman, loved the Suicide Squad jabs, loved Bane. It was stellar through and through. I think I enjoyed it more than The Lego Movie. \n\nI loved the cohesiveness of these Lego films two films in. I honestly thought it was going to be all Gotham, all DC characters and then boom it was basically anything Warner Bros owned. Which was fantastic.\n\nSpeaking of the humor; I went to an 11am IMAX showing. Tons of kids. And from the laughter, or I guess lack of in some places, you could really tell it was parents just taking their kid to the movies to entertain them for the morning. Though in my row there was a dad who before the movie was super excited and telling his daughter, who looked to be about 4, a bunch of stuff about Batman. So that was neat.\n\nThe most surprising thing? The story credit: Seth Grahame-Smith. You know, the dude who was supposed to write and direct The Flash. I now really wonder what his Flash film would have been like. Even if they just used his script. ",

I had a good laugh at seeing all these other lego villains helping the Joker destroy Gotham and even happier to see the Batman villains work to help save the day.\n\nWhile I don't think the movie was as good as the Lego Movie, I really enjoyed it for its characterization and sight gags for Batman fans. There were so many references to early Batman material, and it always got a laugh from me.\n\nAll the voice work was fantastic, with particular mention to Michael Cera who I'd never have recognized if I didn't know it was him before.\n\nOnly a few jokes didn't hit, but the pacing of the movie doesn't let you linger on them too long.",

Deathly Hollows part 2 is 6 years old  \nHe doesn't know the Batman 60s references  \nHe doesn't get the Michael Jackson references.  \nHe doesn't know who the Gremlins are.   \n\nSo while this is a kids movie, and a damn good one, it's definitely more of an older kids movie than the Lego movie was.  Yes there were references to older stuff there too, but a quick call-out to Gandalf and the NBA allstars is a little different than making defeating the all seeing eye of Sauron a central part of your climax.\n\nI'm not complaining mind you.  It's a great movie that made me laugh a ton, but I'd say a solid 80% of the jokes require you to be well invested in pop culture that's at least a decade old.  ",

I'm a huge Arrested Development fan so I went primarily for the vocal talent of Will Arnett and Michael Cera and was pleasantly surprised at how great the movie was overall. The unexpected team of supervillans, especially Voldemort were a great surprise. \n\nThe animation was amazing, much like the original Lego Movie and the jokes were good. The opening riffs from Batman commenting on the Warner Brothers logo and such were a great touch as well.\n\nI'd love a more PG-13 version of the film joke-wise. I feel like Arnett could have easily taken Batman there but I get that the powers that be wanted a financial success and weren't exactly catering to Arnett's core fan base.  ",

It's a straight up parody of Batman, mocking his previous movie iterations and the inherent ridiculousness of a playboy billionaire dressing up as a bat with branded gadgets, while also getting the character right and exploring him in a hyper-meta kind of way. But it also mixes in lessons about family and team work that feel like they're taken straight out of a Disney sob story, which are obviously aimed at a younger audience. This creates a certain imbalance, where the movie tries to be entertaining for all ages but can't really balance the two tones without a noticeable shift from one to the other. This, however, is not a significant fault and doesn't happen too often to be overly distracting. Visually it follows in the footsteps of the first Lego movie with breathtakingly colorful and cinematic animation that often feels like stop motion on speed and is a joy to look at. Not only is this a great animated movie, it's also a hilarious comedy and a cool Batman flick that should be a real crowd pleaser.",

While I understand that the core of the movie was about Batman growing as a person, I am frustrated by the overall shallow feeling the movie left me with. I believe that if it focused either entirely on one of the two relationships, it would have made for a stronger movie and a more enjoyable experience. ",

It was damn awesome. \n\nI liked the 2014 Lego Movie, even though I thought the praise for it was overblown. That one was fun just in the novelty of seeing Legos on the big screen, and just the idea of \"How the hell are they gonna make a movie outta Legos?! Pfft...\" only to take everyone by surprise by actually making it work. But this one took it to that next level where I'm like \"Okay, I see the hype, this one IS that good.\"\n\nIt's a great Batman parody, the best DC superhero movie Warner Bros. has put out in years, and I'd even go as far as to say that it's the best superhero comedy since The Incredibles.\n\nOh yeah, I'm putting it up there with the big dogs. Lemmie found out I'm getting emotional over these damn plastic toys at parts, LOL. But what can I say, man, they really do bring out some relatable, hard-hitting truths in deconstructing the character of Bruce Wanye/Batman, truths that not even some of the heralded live action versions were able to capture. Truths that the aforementioned Incredbiles delved into. It wasn't just all \"LAWLZ zany reference humor\", it had a much bigger heart than I expected (without delving into schmaltz, or stopping the film dead to deliver its message like the 2014 Lego Movie did). Combined with all the homework they did stuffing this film with the clever uses of references and a tight script to bring it all home, this was a GREAT time at the movies and an early contender for my favorites of the year.\n\n...though with how good this movie is, this begs the question: How the HELL are these DCEU movies this bad then? CLEARLY you got folks who know exactly what's wrong with those movies and how to do them right in house, Warner Bros, so here's what ya'll need to do: Just let the creative team behind this do the rest of your DCEU movies from now on. Banish Zack Snyder from the WB lot, disavow David Ayers, lose David Goyer's phone number, and just let Chris McKay and company take it from here. That'd be great, thanks.",

You're the police commissioner's daughter.  You've been brought under the wings (ha) of the city's most badass vigilante.  You have a few disagreements and almost die.  You're also both single.  Not a stretch to imagine sex would happen somewhere in there.  I think the problem is more that it felt kind of wrong, afterwards it kind of felt like a mistake and as the audience I felt like I needed a shower.  That doesn't mean it's bad storytelling, that's what makes drama matter.  One of my favorite parts of the film was the conversation she had with her friend about it after, where she persisted that it didn't mean anything but you can tell she's wrestling with it.  I think most fans were just like, ew, gross, that's not supposed to happen!  But in reality, it probably would, and there would be awkward feelings afterwards. Life isn't perfect and people make mistakes.  That one ended up having pretty significant consequences.",

I was also bummed that Galifinakis's Joker just sounds like.....Zack Galifinakis, and that even Harley Quinn just sounds like Jenny Slate. How do you have Harley Quinn without the accent?\n\nAnd I'm saying that as someone who isn't even a Batman fan, though at least there's enough fun jokes about every era of Batman history that I hope comic book fans have a good time picking that flick apart for every obscure joke and reference (I loved the brief glimpse of shitty 1940's Batman we get, complete with ill-fitting, floppy-eared cowl).\n\nI was also a little bummed that the movie just kinda turns into a commercial/cutscene for Lego Dimensions at the end (and how in the hell did Ralph Feinnes *not* double as Voldemort for the 10 seconds he showed up?), and that the movie is uglier than the Lego Movie was (though I guess it's supposed to be uglier, what with the whole move taking place in dreary Gotham), though the filmmakers also broke The Lego Movie's \"everything-is-made-of-Lego\" rule WAY more often than that first flick did.\n\nBut still, I had a good time! Hopefully there will be some shorts on the Blu-Ray that let all the Batman villains who barely got any screentime (which is pretty much everybody but Joker & Harley Quinn) more of a place to shine.",

I didn't know I ever wanted to see Batman fight The Gremlins but there it is in a movie and its lots of fun. I didn't see much of the promotional material for this so I don't know if they spoiled that aspect or not, but for me it was a genuine surprise. \n\nAlso as a huge Batman fan there was just so much fan service. I did find it odd that *a lot* of their references were targeted more towards an older audience. By this I don't mean it was anything explicit in there, but do kids these days know who the Wonder Twins are? Do they know about Clash of the Titans? Hell do they even know Gremlins? I know that I absolutely appreciated this, but I'm not sure how it will land for other people. \n\n\nAlso having nearly every Batman villain in there was a lot of fun even if they didn't get to do much. On that note though, it made me unreasonably happy that Billy Dee Williams (Lando from Star Wars) actually got to play Two Face after all these years. For those who don't know BDW actually played Harvey Dent in the 1989 version of Batman and was contracted to play Two Face in a sequel. When they eventually recast the role with Tommy Lee Jones he was bought out of his contract. ",

The first Lego Movie had such a poignant ending, it elevated it from a good movie to a great movie. You saw that it wasn't just a movie about Lego's, it was about something more. And here they sort of dance around the notion of family, but never really hit that depth that original did. And it feels like a miss becaue there's stuff they could've played with that would fit in with that - the dynamics of a being a Father and being a Son. ",

Like its still a children's movie, and expecting some marvel of storytelling and scriptwriting beyond that of what children 6-12 would like is silly. Where it held my attention and I got my entertainment value as a Batman fan was from the self parody of the Batman franchise. [The relationship between the Joker and Batman being synonymous with a romantic relationship is great because it so closely mirrors the relationship between the two in more serious movies and shows. All the little callbacks to the original series, particularly the ongoing joke of batman and joker being 70+ years old, are hilarious because they poke at the quirks and continuity issues of the series in a fun and playful way.](#spoiler) \n\nSaying LEGO batman isn't a good movie because it was mostly old Batman references is like saying Galaxy Quest isn't a good movie because it was all old Star Trek references. If you aren't into the series no shit you aren't going to enjoy it but for all of us who are its about as perfect a Batman comedy as we could have hoped for. ",

The ironic thing is the only reason this plot gets used again and again in Batman stories is because writers and fans always push for him to work alone no matter what, e.g. Arkham Games, Nolan Bat Trilogy, etc. And the bit about Joker wanting Batman to admit they have a special relationship? Done to death. Hell they did an entire series in the comics dedicated to that story called Death of the Family. \n\nOh dear me I've disagreed with the overwhelming majority view and am being downvoted for it.

It's clear by watching it that alot of passion went into it and the finished project was good. \n\nNow then, doesn't matter if they are existing IPs that they had ahold of before Lego Dimensions, it doesn't take away from the fact that they are important to the game. Both have their own world kits and several other smaller ones. So featuring them in the movie would make sense from a marketing standpoint. It isn't like the writers just decided to use these villains because it would some how make the movie flow better. They took the best out of what Lego had licenses for and threw them in, and several are the big name IPs that are prominently featured for Lego Dimensions. \n\nThe only reason I even made the joke that it was an ad was because after the movie both me and my friend really wanted to buy Lego Dimensions stuff. \n\nTL Dr: The movie is an ad in the same way the Lego Movie was. It made Legos relevant for a generation of kids who didn't give a shit about them. And that's not even an ad persay. But it doesn't mean that the movie wasn't good.  ",

Jesus Christ, do kids only have the attention span of 0.5 milliseconds these days?  \n\nCompare kids movies these days to something like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, or Beauty and the Beast, it's like hyper active schizophrenic on LSD, coke, and PCP are making movies for kids these days where all they do is shout, scream, and run around all over the place all over the screen for 85 minutes.  Not only do you see it in the Lego movies, you see it in all of the Despicable Me types of films or the Kung Fu Pandas etc.  ",

Holy cow dude you might be on to something here. \n\nAlso, take off the rose-tinted glasses, high energy kids entertainment isn't a \"These days\" thing. See: Ren and Stimpy, Rocko's modern life.\nAlso I'm convinced that if you think that Kung Fu Panda is on the same level as Despicable Me or the Lego movies you haven't actually seen Kung Fu Panda, that movie has about the same pace as those Disney movies you hold on such a high pedestal\n ",
