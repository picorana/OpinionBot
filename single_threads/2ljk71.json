Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, and resulted in 800 terabytes of data. \n\n>The resulting visual effect provided Dr. Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and will lead to the creation of two scientific papers, one for the astrophysics community and one for the computer graphics community.\n\nSo not only what you saw was *mind-blowingly awesome, it was also scientifically correct.*",

And Matt Damon goes crazy, ironically trying to save himself while preaching the opposite. But the AI characters, TARS and CASE seem to be the only ones 100% dedicated to the human cause; willing to sacrifice themselves for the good of mankind. But then again, they are robots and do what they are told. \n\nAlso, could this be the second installment in a trilogy of movies where Nolan blows people up mid sentence?",

Humans couldn't commit the atrocity of bombing other thousands or millions of other humans, so the robots were created to fill that role.",

He could bed down until they got back but he wouldn't have accomplished any work as they were trying to decipher some problems with the black hole so he figured he'd try to be productive rather than sleep it off and wait for them.\n\nSeems as though he chose correct as he dies shortly after.

No way they were down there for 3 hours, I don't think. The actual space-time effect was much more intense than they calculated for. Their perception of how long an hour is on the planet would not have been skewed, as they were experiencing it in their context of how long an hour should be. \n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, I'm no astrophysicist. That's what made it even more tragic. He came up expecting  less than or equal to seven years, when he heard 23 he fucking lost it.",

I know the runtime was already crazy long, but there were a number of scenes, interactions, and ideas that the movie shows, but, imo, doesnt explore enough.  Like the deterioration of sanity from isolation.  i feel like Romilly, but especially Dr. Mann, would have been a bit more peculiar and socially strange.  they hint at this a bit, but then, when the plot needs to move a long, Romilly and Mann are basically fully functioning people, like nothing ever happened.  And i know Dr. Mann, did kind of go crazy with his deception and derangement, but i dont think he would have been able to have kept such composure and facade of normality after being alone for so long. idk, i guess im just nit-picking. loved the movie tho, very original and thought provoking. and especially visually stunning.",

Even the music, as I recall, made it feel like hell. This moment reminded me of Jodie Foster toward the end of Contact (surprised others haven't brought up Contact in this thread), or when David (Haley Joel Osmet) ends up at the bottom of the ocean in A.I. Ultimately, ending the movie at that point would've been less cheesy, but just way to sad/hopeless. ",

It was highlighted in the scene where Cooper gave Romilly the audio of Earth (crickets, rain), after Romilly voiced his discomfort of floating in the void. The first thing Mann expressed when waking up was that he hoped they never knew how good it could be to see another face. He admitted his struggle of wether or not to press the button upon realiZing his planet wasn't the one. Sure, his decision didn't stem completely from being alone, but it clearly played a role. Mann, NASA's model austronaut, couldn't handle the thought of denying alone and betrayed his species. Romilly, on the other hand, had a fear of being alone and hopeless but remained loyal to his crew.",

Just listing elements as I recall them:  \n\n* The black hole scene, very obviously reminiscent of Dave in hyperspace\n\n* A talking computer system that essentially runs the ship, though TARS is obviously much more benevolent than HAL\n\n* TARS even looks like a monolith  \n\n* Cooper reuniting with old Murph, similar to where Dave sees himself as an old man.  \n\n* Cooper floats unconscious in space after exiting the 5th dimension, very reminiscent of the final shot of 2001  \n\n* Both plots center around a mission to another planet to explore the future of the human race  \n\n* Space station with rotational gravity, and ships that sync their rotation to dock with it\n\n* Cryo-sleep (though this and the last bullet point are somewhat common tropes in space sci-fi)  \n\n* Video messages to children back on earth  \n\n* And just the general tone & feel of the movie, presenting space sci-fi in such an incredibly immersive way relative to its contemporaries\n\nAnd there may be more that I either missed or don't recall at the moment. At any rate, there were so many parallels and they were so immediately obvious to me that I'm quite sure this was Nolan's intention. But like I said, maybe this has already been put out there in the run-up to the film's release. I wouldn't know as I deliberately went out of my way to read and see as little as possible about this movie before watching it. ",

If you know Matt Damon will show up at some point, it kind of takes that away. Seriously, just screw people, just screw them right in their face.\n\nAlso, I was reading one review, I think by The Atlantic where they basically just told the entire plot, I exited early because they put a spoiler warning so I got lucky. But seriously, why can't people just review the movie? Even before that, The Atlantic was just giving away too many plot points. They also explained how they discovered the NASA facility.

Copied from the wiki\n\n*\"In creating the wormhole and a supermassive rotating black hole, which as opposed to a non-rotating black hole possesses an ergosphere, Dr. Thorne collaborated with visual effect supervisor Paul Franklin and a team of 30 computer effects artists at Double Negative. Thorne would provide pages of deeply sourced theoretical equations to the artists, who then wrote new CGI rendering software based on these equations to create accurate computer simulations of the gravitational lensing caused by these phenomena. Some individual frames took up to 100 hours to render, and ultimately resulted in 800 terabytes of data. The resulting visual effect provided Dr. Thorne with new insight into the effects of gravitational lensing and accretion disks surrounding black holes, and will lead to the creation of two scientific papers; one for the astrophysics community and one for the computer graphics community.[58]\"*\n\nTL;DR new CGI software written just for that scene, 800TBS of data, new insights into gravitational lensing, 2 scientific papers written",

Sci-Fi is supposed to break beyond the limitations of our understanding of the universe into a world that is great and filled with wonder.\n\nThis movie is simply another testament to why Christopher Nolan is my favorite director...

The two plot holes with that are this: The planets would be bathed in deadly radiation, two they shouldn't be there in the first place as Gargantua's ~~supernova (which formed the black hole) would have utterly destroyed them.~~ Edit: Gargantua is apparently supposed to be a supermassive black hole (SMBH), the type you find at the center of galaxies whose origins aren't yet clear in current physics. So while the planets wouldn't have necessarily deal with a supernova (assuming they formed after the black hole did), it's still pretty far fetched. SMBH's are *enormous,* millions of Suns in mass.\n\nHowever, considering that the whole movie is being orchestrated by unseen hyperdimensional humans, they could have set this all up considering their mastery of spacetime, so I'll let these slide.\n\nSide note: Gargantua ~~is probably part of a binary system with a neutron star~~ [Edit: probably has a neutron star as a satellite] as Cooper mentions using the star as a slingshot to reach on of the planets. We know planets can orbit binary systems, so it's this aspect isn't unphysical.",

The story was so well told and there was so much creativity that I feel SciFi in general has been lacking.\n\nI also really loved the robot design.  I loved that they made the depiction of wormholes/black holes as accurate as possible.  The design of the space ship was realistic, no shiny fancy glowy stuff.  \n\n\nIt might sound weird, but after seeing that I kind of wish it was real.  Not the tragic stuff exactly, but the idea of making time tangible, really finding a way to keep mankind alive, and so forth.\n\nEdit:  Was the detonation scene reminiscent of when The Joker plants a bomb in the prisoner in TDK to anyone else?  The way the music ramped up, the mention of the data making no sense similar to the mentioning of the contusion, etc.",

At one point I was expecting the robots to go rogue HAL-Style, at another point I was expecting Cooper to stumble upon \"they\" (elder beings, a-la-lovecraft), and at another time I was even expecting aliens to show up on one planet and chase them off.\n\nI think Nolan exploited the fact that we're so used to seeing different crazy shit happen in sci-fi films and always built up the tension to lead us to believe any of that stuff MIGHT be able to happen. In the end, my mind was just blown away by that climax. The fact that something so important like the survival of the human race was solved by something as subtle as a man communicating with his daughter by moving the seconds hands on a watch. \n\nAnother really amazing scene for me was when Murph was hugging her brother after she figured out that her dad was communicating with her through space time. Seeing her smile at the light of that discovery vs her brother staring with that dead, hopeless look on his dirt covered face was pretty scary. Sort of reminds you that despite the human race discovering a way for it's species to survive which will overjoy many, even more will be left behind on the bare, hopeless wasteland the earth will become, and die.\n\nAmazing, mind blowing movie. Not just because of the tension and epicness of the movie, but also because of the really small things.",

But she really enjoyed this one, it had a lot of excellent touches that a \"hard sci-fi\" buff can really enjoy, without being too confusing to those who aren't familiar with relativistic time compression. \n\nAs the movie built towards the conclusion, I was almost ready to walk out of the theater depressed because it was doomed to have an unhappy ending. It felt almost a tiny bit contrived to arrive at the very satisfying and smile-inducing ending, but, I really am totally okay with that. Everyone in the theater had been on a hell of a roller coaster ride for three hours, and we just kinda needed to have the kind of ending we got. Thank you, Mr. Nolan. \n\nMy wife ended up openly sobbing at least once during the movie, I was only slightly more composed. Being a father to teenagers of my own, there's so many feelings of parenthood that resonated.\n\nTotally did not expect: The robots to be the show-stealers. Somewhere, Isaac Asimov is giving a nod of approval. \n\nI usually don't think IMAX adds a lot to movies, but in this case, the extra couple bucks were totally worth it. \n\nAnd one more credit: The audience where I saw the movie was terrific. Not a single cellphone ringing, nothing more than an occasional whisper to be heard, even in a totally sold-out mega-theater.\n",

The people who helped us, \"they\" were suppose to be us from the future, but how since he was a ghost in the timeline before he even left.  The second viewing and it's clear that McConaughey is insistent on \"they\" being us.  Then it hit me that the only reason the people on earth got saved is because of Plan B.  So she does make it to the planet like the end indicates and humanity does survive and evolve and since she knew where he sacrificed himself, she was able to pass that information on and in the future when humans evolved to 5th dimension beings, they knew exactly where to go to pick him up and to have him help pass on the necessary information to his daughter back in time.  I must say I'm glad I watched it a second time and enjoy the movie even more now.\n\nEdit: It was pointed out below that it doesn't explain the wormhole in the first place.  After thinking about it, it's true that this theory doesn't explain why it showed up in the first place.  Perhaps there was another entity looking out for us, one where we haven't been able to explain or explore just yet.  Like the theme of love that she was describing in the middle of the film.  Whether it's God, Aliens, or beings of another sort.  Without the wormhole none of the other stuff would've worked out for us.  Someone out there wanted us to survive. ",

            "body": "In a word? Mesmerizing. This is a great movie right here\u2026 especially compared to the crap that is being churned out of Hollywood at the moment. Just when you thought that all creativity was gone and you\u2019re going to spend the rest of your life watching recreations of comic books\u2026 along comes something refreshing even though it\u2019s been hiding in science fiction novels for a long, long time. You just never got that far down the aisle at your local library. \n\nThe problem, of course, with any film that takes a stab at explaining vastly complicated subjects (i.e. relativity, time dilation, gravity\u2019s role in unified field theory, worm holes, space/time relations, etc.) is that the super-smart who understand all of that want to pick it apart. Let\u2019s be real for a second. Nobody TRULY understands all the space/time stuff. If we did, we would already be jumping galaxies in our space ships. So there\u2019s going to be a little mysticism any time these ideas are made into movies. But for me, that\u2019s fine. \n\nYou see, the laws of physics in space are boring. Everything takes forever to accomplish, and there\u2019s no sound. So you don\u2019t get a satisfying \u201cclick\u201d when space ships dock. There\u2019s not a \u201cBoom!\u201d when something explodes. So there is a competition which exists whereby film directors must somehow keep you from yawning while trying to stick to known physics laws in a film such as this. They could have gone the other way (I\u2019m looking at you, Armageddon), where \u201cwho cares about physics\u201d is the theme. Thank God they didn\u2019t. \n\nOk so you have a great premise for a sci-fi flick, and you put it out there on the big screen for the world to evaluate. Here come the arm-chair intellectuals who will bring up plot holes and such, simply for the joy of feeling superior and trying to impress everyone with their abounding knowledge of astrophysics. I think these guys are missing the point. This is about entertainment\u2026 not academic instruction. And that, my friends, is what this film delivers. It entertains you. You know that you've been entertained when you leave the theater and realize that it\u2019s been 3 hours since you sat down. You know it because for the next few days, you look up at the sky and dream. You find yourself nostalgic for a time when this nation was striving to be more than anyone thought possible\u2026 and you regret the decisions which have grounded our space program. \n\nI remember once I spoke with a young man about his favorite film at the time. It was a remake of a G.I. Joe movie, and he had been rather fond of the action figures/cartoons as a child. He loved the reboot movie, and I could see the child-like love in his eyes of someone bringing the nostalgia of his youth to life on the big screen. I didn\u2019t want to point out the fact that nobody who wrote or directed that movie knew anything about physics. (Remember when the ice sank? Ice doesn\u2019t do that in the real world). But that wasn\u2019t the point, you see. And the same should apply for this movie. \n\nHere, I am the wide-eyed kid again, watching this movie and yearning for the days when I felt pride in my country for their efforts in space exploration. Yes, there was a nagging part of my brain that kept reminding me that a time dilation factor of 1:60,000 around a singularity was impossible because you would have to cross the event horizon to achieve that\u2026 and that a stable orbit around such an imperfectly shaped anomaly would have to be 3X larger to accomplish, which would exponentially reduce the dilation factor. But I didn\u2019t care! They got a lot right in this movie, and I could swallow the rest easily because this movie made me feel young again. And that\u2019s why I spent my money to see it. \n\nIf you\u2019re one of \u201cthose guys\u201d who want to show off your mental testosterone and brag about the lack of gravitation diffraction ripples and things that you thought were so obviously wrong with the movie that it made you not like it\u2026 I feel sorry for you. You have totally missed the point, and you\u2019re ruining everyone else\u2019s fun. That doesn\u2019t make you the life of the party. \n\nTo everyone else, who do not need to know how a refrigerator works in order to use it, please go see this movie and ignore the \u201cnitpickers\u201d whose sense of self-worth comes from dissecting and over-thinking any movie in this genre to death. These people complain that there aren\u2019t any good science fiction movies any more, then when a good one comes along, they pick it apart and tell everyone about every detail that was improperly delivered.  News flash, guys: maybe that is why you don\u2019t see so many of these movies? Do us all a favor. Turn off your over-worked brain for 3 hours, sit back, have some popcorn, and try to enjoy this movie. \n",

It was already established that there are no habitable planets in our solar system and that we need the wormhole. On the other end of the wormhole there were 12 planets, 3 of which had a thumbs up, 2 of which ended up being a bust and the last possible planet was Brand's planet.\n\nSo, if Murph is on her death bed and she sends Coop to find Brand, where the hell did humanity go? How did they get all advanced and great? What, did they just fly off into space and suddenly everything was fine? They didn't have anything new compared to the underground facility on Earth, no way to grow new food...\n\n**TLDR: Between Murph receiving Coop's black hole message and Coop waking up, where did humanity go if not Brand's planet, the last habitable planet.**\n\n[In the IGN interview they ask a similar question and Nolan just kind of bullshits around it.](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/08/jonathan-nolan-interstellar-spoilers)\n\n",

At one point I was so surprised I turned around and just looked at the other movie-goers (quietly, don't worry...I am not one of *those* movie-goers haha) like, \"Oh wow did you guys *see* that?!\" I totally became a little girl immersed in a movie and totally in awe of what I was seeing...kind of like when I experienced Jurassic Park in theaters as a kid.

It takes 4-5 hours to get to the Endurance station. Then they blast off in hibernation, and spend 2 years traveling, but they wake up as if the past two years were just yesterday. When they arrive to the wormhole it takes approximately another 10 hours to get through it (Brand says that they are 3 hours away from the wormhole). They spend only 3-4 hours on the water planet as mentioned in the posts above. Maybe another 1-2 days on the ice planet, and then when Cooper ejects him self into the Gargantuan, it seems like he spends an hour at the book case and then when the book case explodes he is ejected back into the Saturn orbital. \n\nHe consciously spends 3-4 days on the mission.",

To Nolan-haters, this movie will probably just reaffirm everything they don't like about him. Interstellar won't be converting very many Nolan non-believers in my opinion. \n\nThe visuals are there. The sound design is amazing and the performances are on the money. When it comes down to it, I think liking the movie comes down to whether or not you buy into the hokeyness. The dialogue and themes grow cheesier, especially during the third act. We also have a questionable Matt Damon cameo.\n\nIf you're like me though, you ate it all up. The film hit all the right notes for me personally, especially when Cooper was leaving his family one last time. The countdown was perfectly placed, awesome editing. I don't care what anyone says about Nolan, I thought Interstellar was powerful and emotional. This movie wasn't perfect but their were so many cool ideas and visuals, I was so immersed.\n\nI'd give it a 8.5/10.. Only after the first viewing though.\n\n\n",

The idea is that OUR UNIVERSE, from the outside, is a singularity; a floating piece of space and time whose only definition is 'one.' A black hole is supposed to be the same thing, a naked singularity inside of a Universe (which is just another singularity.) So when Cooper fell inside the black hole the infinite gravity of the singularity was able to force him through the 3rd dimension and into the 4th, where he could observe the one Universe from the outside and tinker with the fabric of space-time and was then able to communicate with his daughter by pressing on the fabric of space-time accountable for the hour hand on his daughters watch. But what made it really deep was the fact that the reason he was there, was for the love of his daughter giving an example of how and why love is the strongest force in the Universe.",

            "body": "I just need to vent. I can't remember the last time I was this moved by an experience at the theatre. I was literally shaken. I didn't sleep tonight. That was arguably the best experience I have ever had in a theatre. I cried at the emotional parts. I popped a boner at the astro physics and exploration parts. I have never been so immersed in anything, maybe ever, besides like, ocarina of time when I was 7 or whatever and it was possible to lose myself entirely. I feel like a little kid again. \n\nI am so pissed by many of these (typically very old, conservative) critics who are trashing the movie for its \"ridiculous story\". What? This is basically a true fucking story, it just hasn't happened yet. (Well, not the conclusion but the premise). How can you call this a ridiculous, implausible story? This is the story of human kind's attempt to survive the eventual loss of our home planet. Unless something whipes us out too quickly at some point, this will literally happen to an extent. \n\nI read somewhere that maybe it's \"intellectual reach went further than its grasp\", or something like that. Well, that is actually true and pretty well said, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. The shit is supposed to go over our heads, especially towards the end. That's the point. Just adds to the feeling of mysticism, awe, and inspiration I felt for 10 hours after leaving the theatre. \n\nThen there's the emotional, dramatic aspect of the film which, while maybe a bit cliche at times, was still profound.  I mean, I rarely cry in movies but I can think of three distinct times I had tears streaming down my face because of Matt's nuanced delivery of the extremely intense emotions that went along with what he was going through. That's the stuff of life right there. I was as heavily moved (emotionally) by this movie as I have been by any pure, non scientific dramas in the past. This movie nailed both of the genres at once (sci-fi and love/human nature). It fucking nailed them. NAILED them. I've never given a shit about reviews but some of the negetive ones I have read literally make me cringe. Anyone who hates this movie just hates sci fi. And if you're left with ONLY the emotional parts and no other story to latch on to, I can see how the movie might drag and feel a bit empty. But if you hate Sci FI, (especially a subject so close to home), than you suck and shouldn't be reviewing the God damned movie. \n\nI'm not commenting on whether it's the best movie I have ever seen because that can take years to ferment, but I think it's certainly the best and most profound, moving experience I have ever had in a theatre. I feel like a new man today. I mean I literally am a depressed person (and have been for 3 years in a rut) and I feel motivated about my life today for the first time in 3 years because of what I experienced last night (from 12 to 3 AM, alone! Haha). \n\nAnyway, just had to get that off my chest. So glad I made that spontaneous decision at 11:45 last night. \n\nWow. \n\nJust wow. \n\nWow. \n\n.....\n\nWow.  \n\nEdit: rushed through first draft on iPhone.... You know how it is. \n\nEdit 2: I.... Gold? ",

                    "body": "You give good points, but most of the legit negative reviews about this film talk about the dialogue and the pacing. The story and scale were amazing, and like you said it had some heart wrenching scenes, but in my opinion it was kind of cringy when Brand wanted to go to her boyfriends planet and started to talk about love and how it exist, right then you knew that was a pre cursor to help solve the gravity equation. That little girls acting didn't help either. \n\n\nI guess a little more subtle is what I expect from Nolan. I guess a good example of this would be 2 face in The Dark Knight, at first viewing most people couldn't see him becoming a villain so that was a big shock, but upon further watching there were little nuances in his character that indicated he had those tendencies.\n\n\nAs far as the pacing goes, what comes to mind is that heavy scene of Cooper leaving Murph then they go right into joking around on the ship.\n\n\nHonestly I think people are so harsh on the dialogue because Prometheus still left a bitter taste in peoples mouths for space exploration movies. It's almost as if people want either the lightheartedness of the new Star Trek/ Guardians of the Galaxy, or they want all dialogue to be as serious as 2001.\n\n\nAll in all great movie theater experience though, I might go see it once more in a regular theater to see if the IMAX truly made a difference. I don't see myself watching this on DVD over and over again like I watch Dark Knight though.",

It was visually phenomenal and I really liked the representation of 5 dimensional space in three dimensions and allusions to string theory was very cool. A of 2001 in this movie, the fly by of Saturn, the syncing up of the rotating ships, representing space as a physical dimension. one thing I feel might have gone over my head is whether or not 'They' ever actually existed? Anyway really loved the film, particularly watching 'Coop' go through 23 years of missed video messages from his family.",

This would mean that the new civilization got to the point where they were able to communicate with the past and thus give Cooper the knowledge required to save the inhabitants of Earth.\n\nAll in all though, this is probably one of my favourite movies of all time. I remember specifically during that wide angle shot of Saturn that I said to myself, out load, \"man I like this movie\".\nBetween the music, the plot and the shots that looked like they were done with miniatures, this movie had a very 1980's science fiction feel to it. I'm a person who hates when directors go overboard on cheap CGI(see: The Hobbit) but the special effects in this movie were brilliant. I felt like I was a kid again reading one of my older brother's comic books while he was at school.\n\nI wasn't huge on TDKR, but this film has restored my faith in Nolan. Easy 9/10.\n",

This is a good perspective on the 5th dimension as it self, however, since he is the one who gave out the NASA coordinates to his past self and basically was the catalyst for the entire movie, this leads me to the MAIN question, how did he get there for the first time?\nI mean, for him to be able to send a message to his former self, he had to receive this message from his future self, and if he never received this message, never got the NASA coordinates, then he never flew through the wormhole at all...\n\nGuys please help, this ruins the whole movie for me!",

It wasn't perfect.  I wasn't thrilled with the wrapped in a bow resolution for Cooper, Tom's character development was basically non-existent, and you have to take some massive leaps in logic, but this film succeeded based on 1 main reason for me.  I cared about the characters.  I was seriously having to hold back tears everytime Cooper had to face the life he lost with his daughter.   I was beyond thrilled that they didn't go with a stereotypical romantic subplot between Cooper and Brand.  And while I thought that they devoted a bit too much time to Tom's family, considering he was basically a throwaway character, the section of the movie devoted to their entire time on the Dr Mann's planet, and his attempt to hijack Endurance was absolutely perfect, and I wouldn't change any of it.\n\n\nEdit:  Was anyone else just waiting for the Aliens to show up.  Especially once they started their hibernation, I just waited and waited, and nothing ever burst out of anyone's chest.  That was my only big disappointment of the movie.",

Also was not too keen on the Matt Damon/Sunshine-esque part of the plot.\n\nHonestly, it played to both Christopher Nolan's strengths and weaknesses, and the space scenes really got to show us how good he can be visually.  There was never a dull moment to this film.\n\nOverall really good movie that reached for the stars both literally and figuratively and came away mostly successful.

That is why they are the same age at the end.\n",

            "body": "It was so many things. It was good, bad, ridiculous, emotional. It's going to be hard to sum this one up. Everyone who asks me how it was all I can say is how much time do you have. I'll just split this up into good things and bad things, but if it makes any difference I did like it, despite the negatives. There was just so much of it I was bound to have issues with some of it.\n\nGood things:\n\n- There were several good emotional highs. Certain scenes did a great job of hitting those climaxes that the rest of the movie was building to. Not to say that the humanity and all of the scenes involving emotion were perfect, but when the peaks came they were well delivered.\n\n\n- I saw it in 35mm and the visuals were stunning. If it were any other time of year I might carve out time to go see it again in digital since the visuals were a real strong point, but my list of movies to see in theaters is very long right now. The scenes that took place on Earth weren't very special, but basically everything in space or on another planet looked somewhere in the range of great to fantastic.\n\n\n- The performances are as good as the script allows. Some of the characters get a lot more depth than others, but everyone pulls their weight. If at any given moment you don't believe what's being said it's likely because of the script and not the actors. McConaughey is especially good as I'm sure will surprise no one.\n\n\n- The score is great. Not that anyone expected Hans Zimmer to just shit on a tape recorder and call it a day, but it was a unique and fitting score that stood out to me. It built up with the longer scenes well, the powerful moments were powerful, and the music was different enough from anything else you hear in movies that it stood out.\n\n\n- Extremely strong third act. Once they are deep into their mission things get really interesting. Basically once they get on the second planet to the end is a great ride. The black hole scene was amazing visually, the Matt Damon plotline was interesting, even the first planet they visited had an interesting arc to it. I really enjoyed about everything that happened in space or on a foreign planet.\n\n\nQuestionable things:\n\n\n- The first 45 minutes were a chore. It's all really well summed up in the trailer so it feels like you're learning stuff you already know and it takes a long time to get to the launch. Which is interesting considering the plot conveniences that get them to launch felt really rushed. Like, McConaughey finds NASA, and in no time at all they are like, \"Thank God you're here because we totally need someone to pilot our interstellar voyage that starts tomorrow.\" Edit: **Okay guys, I get it. I shouldn't watch trailers for things I want to see. That's kind of difficult when you see a lot of movies in theaters and also when you moderate a large internet movie forum, but I understand your points. If you think this criticism is moot because of that, feel free to direct your attention to any of the other things I had to say about this movie.**\n\n\n- One thing that was attempted in the first half but not executed well, IMO, was the world building. The things you learn that weren't in the trailer mainly had to do with the state of the world in this semi futuristic landscape. They mention there's no military but they still pay taxes and the Government is often referred to as scrambling at this point. The problem is it all takes place on a farm or in a farm town, so you don't really see any difference. They talk about the food shortage but you don't really see any large scale toll it's taken on the world. It's all implied which kind of ruined the epic scale of what Coop has to do.\n\n\n- Some of the themes were so obvious that subtext was left out a lot. A physical example of this would be when Coop wakes up Matt Damon from cryo sleep and Damon is giving that talk about what it's like to be truly alone.\n\n\n>You literally raised me from the dead.\n\n>...Lazarus.\n\n- Like, they had already discussed earlier in the film the implications of naming the project Lazarus. They should have left both the explanation of what Lazarus is, and that reminder that the project is called Lazarus when Damon says that out of the movie. Saying them to us like that shows little faith in the audience. And that happened a few times. There was a scene where they were debating what planet to go to next and McConaughey outs Hathaway for being in love with the astronaut on the planet he didn't want to go to. And from then on the conversation turns oddly philosophical as she explains that love can transcend dimension and time and if she can love someone who is galaxies away then that means his planet is the one. It's not subtle either, Cooper doesn't say she was in a relationship with him he says, \"It should be known that Brand is in love with Dr. Whatshisface\" like they had to use the word love. The following conversation is kind of ridiculous and obviously only there to plant the seed for Cooper to give that speech about love when he's in the black hole. Though I will say it was interesting that Hathaway's character ended up being right.\n\n\n- Maybe this issue is because I'm a dumb dumb but I didn't feel like anything was explained to me when things were being explained. Like, in Inception when they explained things they did it in a way that everyone could understand. I had a hard time keeping track of what Plan A was and what the equation was going to do to make it work other than be a huge macguffin for everyone on Earth. That's not to say that what the characters were saying was wrong or illogical, just that I didn't understand it all and I'm generally a very adept viewer so it's hard for me to say the blame was entirely on my side of the fence. Normally in movies when characters explain things in terms over the audiences head there would be a simple summation but I didn't get that in this movie. I know it's funny to say that too much of the subtext was explained and not enough of the plot, but it should really be reversed. The subtext should be left up to interpretation and the plot and rules should be plainly stated for the movie to exist within.\n\n\nOverall, as I said, I still enjoyed the movie. It was worth the price of admission and I'd probably even see it again. But it had some issues, there were times when I was just thinking, \"Really?\" Because I felt like Nolan should know better by now on some of this stuff. I'd say the RT score got this one about right. Some people won't be able to forgive the questionable stuff, and some people will love what's good about it enough to not even notice those things. And the stuff that's good about it is really good, so who can blame them?",

A common criticism I hear of Nolan is that he struggles with exposition, which I haven't necessarily agreed before, but it's definitely the biggest flaw with Interstellar.  \nWe understand from Murphy & Cooper's relationship that love is a powerful motivator, we don't need Anne Hathaway to tell us that it's magic & can travel through time.  \nWe get the implications of Matt Damon \"coming back from the dead\" on a mission called Lazarus, we didn't Cooper to say \"Lazarus\" in an awed voice.\nWe get that Cooper was the ghost, we're watching him doing the ghost things, we don't need the robot giving us a play-by-play of what is going on while Cooper & Murph are both also telling us that Cooper is the ghost all at the same time.  \nWe get that the fate of the world depends on the mission, we don't need Michael Caine to recite Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night 3 damn times. \n\nOther than that, I thought the plot was good (although the twist was predictable) & the acting was great (especially from Mackenzie Foy). I did enjoy the movie much more than it sounds like.",

Like when the Dr explains to Cooper what a wormhole is and why it's spherical -- how could Cooper be a pilot going to a wormhole and not know what one is ? And then they explain relativity to him -- no way would he be a NASA astronaut, top engineer, and not understand relativity. Astronauts are super-bright and very well educated in maths and physics. It's classic American: the hero cannot be too clever, he (always a he) must be a seat-of-his-pants kinda guy. Like the role George Bush played. He can have clever advisers, but he *must* be an Ordinary Joe.",

            "body": "I doubt anyone will see this but here is my little review I wrote for myself:\n\nWhen I first saw the trailer for Interstellar, I was slightly intrigued, but I wasn\u2019t sure if it would be something I wanted to see. As time went by, I got more and more interested in the film, and by the week before it came out, I was definitely in the camp of I had to see it, on IMAX.\n \nThe film was breathtaking visually. IMAX is such a spectacular way to see a film that has scenes that basically make you feel like you are on a rollercoaster. Space, and the planets, was awe inspiring to see, it created such a sense of how small we are in our world. I had a moment of pure joy of just seeing the vastness and dark beauty of space displayed before me. Worth the $20 ticket just for those moments alone I would say.\n \nThe story told is rare for sci-fi stories released by Hollywood. It is completely about man, and his place in the universe. It is all about our struggle, and our journey. The characters seem more real for the most part, everyone has greatness and flaws. There are hints as to why the world is in the shape it is in currently, but not many. Still, there is enough discussion of what happened before, the history of the last 50 years to current, which help give you a decent understanding of what is going on.\n \nThere are many callbacks to previous sci-fi films such as 2001 through music, dialog, and the way certain items are built. There is a grand scale that is communicated well, from the planets they visit, to the undertaking of saving humanity.\n \nThe sound was a little overwhelming at times. The musical score or the roar of the rockets would overpower the dialog. I don\u2019t believe the things said were of any importance, it was mostly stuff about taking off and maybe a funny quip.\n \nI want to see this again, in IMAX if possible.\n \nNow for the ending. If you haven\u2019t seen the film yet, you should stop now, because I need to discuss the ending with myself here in this review.\n \n***SPOILERS BELOW ***\n \nI\u2019m just not sure how I feel about the ending. I understand why they went that way, and it makes sense in the reality that they put together, but it seemed to be thrown together, to existential. It did explain the parts of the movie with the \u2018ghost\u2019 and gave those parts at least reasoning, but I just feel that something else could have happened. It was odd I thought that they could receive messages from Earth, but couldn\u2019t transmit. Maybe it had to do with their antennae, I don\u2019 t know. As I\u2019m typing this out, I\u2019m starting to see why they went with this ending though. If they wanted to have the theory for plan A be the savior of the human race, then they needed the info from the other side of the black hole. But the only way to get that info would be something that we just don\u2019t know exists. Plus, they didn\u2019t go for the easy way out of just spitting him out into Murph\u2019s bedroom when she was older, they dropped him off I\u2019m assuming just outside the wormhole again. I think I\u2019m beginning to justify in my mind the ending, in that because it is so difficult to come up with something that makes sense in our universe, which I guess they just wouldn\u2019t be able to do, they created something that might seem farfetched, but is still a plausible solution within the reality that they have been establishing basically since the beginning of the movie. Definitely something I\u2019ll probably struggle with a bit, but I think I\u2019m beginning to lean towards liking the ending more.\n",

This is why Dr. Mann refused to accept that his planet wasn't habitable, and that is why the teacher believed that agriculture was more important than migration.

It's truly an emotional rollercoaster, I felt exhausted leaving the theater, but in a good way. \n\nAs for weither or not there are plot holes in regards to the science,  that's not the point. It's the willing suspension of disbelief. It's believable enough for you to go with it so that Nolan can tell you the story he wants to tell, which has nothing to do with science. Dispite all the space time distortion, all the time dilation, and all the quantum physics involved, the film is about what someone will do for their family.

Best Nolan flick since Memento imo. \n\n**Two things that irritated me :**\n\n(1) The whole love spiel while Cooper was in the tesseract was a little bit grating to me; and\n\n(2) Constantly repeating the Dylan Thomas poem. The first time was awesome and hit hard. Second time, I thought... ok... you want to repeat it. I get it, Chris. But then a third time and then written again on the statue at the end. Enough already! (Interestingly, Dylan Thomas died of pneumonia brought on by New York smog at the age of 39, which had some parallels with Tom's family's health problems).\n\n**Two things that I didn't understand:**\n\n(1) What caused the explosion that Romilly died in? Are we just supposed to assume that Dr. Mann set some sort of booby trap in case some other human discovered his plot to get saved? That doesn't make a lot of sense to me... he would have had to have set the trap before he even woke up, which would have made his chances at rescue even lower. I feel like I'm missing something here.\n\n(2) What was the point of the data that Cooper put into Murph's watch supposed to help humanity do? I didn't really get that part of \"plan A\"... that Prof. Brand was supposed to sit back and solve some equation so that they could get off the planet? And then he solved the equation, but knew it wouldn't get them anywhere, so lied to Murph about it for years until he dies... and then Cooper gets the TARS robot to give him some reading from a black hole that puts a new spin on it, sends it back in time to Murph by playing a harp in the tesseract, and then they can suddently blast humanity out into space... but I thought they already had the capability of putting people into space? What was the point of Murph's \"eureka\" moment? \n\nAnd somewhat related... the humans in the space station at the end... did you suppose they were they all headed to the planet that Brand had landed at? Or just chilling in their new space homes?\n\nAnyway, not trying to poke holes in the plot. It was one of my favorite movie-going experiences that I can remember. A very powerful movie.",

Like Terminator or 12 Monkeys, someone is going back in time to provide information or make a decision that allows the future where they go back in time to provide information that allows the future, etc.\n\nBut it makes perfect sense that the higher beings, \"They\", could be the progeny of Brand's planet, that Earth DID go under and it was Brand's planet that ended up fostering life in a way that allowed humanity to evolve to understand the fifth dimension (or fourth, I don't quite understand the fifth part, it seems that TIME is the fourth dimension, therefore they only evolved to use four dimensions).\n\nDoes this make sense? I'm readily willing to accept the total sci-fi bootstrap paradox in the context of this flick but it also seems likely that that doesn't HAVE to be the case.... It seems like the real bootstrap paradox would happen when Cooper GOES to Brand's planet and tells her all about his journey, which would undoubtably influence the future of Brand's world.\n\nVery complex movie in some way, ultimately a FANTASTIC journey full of wonder and amazing visuals. Hope someone cares to comment on this idea, thanks!",

Maybe it was the clear 2001 influences, but I kept thinking \"hope those things don't go crazy on the crew\".  Cooper even made a comment about how they had a tendency to malfunction upon his arrival at NASA.  With all that said, CASE and especially TARS were probably my favorite \"characters\" in the film.

I loved the science and the concepts of multiple dimensions it introduces to the audience, especially the notion of love being quantifiable in a subject as complex quantum mechanics.  \n\nI understand a lot of people have a problem with the (apprent?) time paradox being a hole in the plot, but I can easily dismiss that out of hand.  If the \"we\" from the future have evolved enough to exist in multiple dimensions, concepts such as time paradoxes may not even be a problem for a species that exist in past, present and future simultaneously.  The only part of the film that confused me was this:\n\nCooper sacrifices himself along with TARS to help ensure that Brand slingshots around Gargantua safely.  He then ejects from his ship and crosses Gargantua's even horizon.  He is able to do this and not succumb to spaghettification because of the sheer size of Gargantua; there is enough space between the event horizon and the actual black hole for a person to theoretically exist beyond the event horizon before being ultimately annihilated by a giant sized black hole.  Once past the EH, the \"us\" from the future create a tesseract for Cooper to communicate to Murph.  What I can't understand is how Cooper is then transported from Gargantua back through the wormhole and set to drift on the other side to be safely picked up.  How was he transported out of Gargantua?  ",

I *almost* wished I'd seen it on a smaller screen, perhaps even my laptop or TV at home. Don't get me wrong, it was breathtakingly gorgeous on the Imax screen and the mise-en-scene was spectacular. But the story is so anchored to these central characters, especially Cooper and Murph, it felt like a personal drama. It felt at once sweepingly vast and private. The emotional moments worked so well because I felt like I was watching a crucial portion of these people's lives. I haven't been able to fully process it because I saw it a couple hours ago, but that was the first thought I had about it. Haven't been able to concentrate on anything besides the movie since I walked out of it.",

That entire element of the movie felt rushed to me. Maybe some of it got lost on the cutting room floor, it was nearly 3 hours already. \n\n* The acting was very well accomplished\n\n* The cinematography was excellent. The scene where cooper needed to dock to the spinning station gave me chills in the way that it conveyed the inertia and rotational speed of the station without missing any of the action all while managing not to give the audience motion sickness. \n\n* The story had a few holes that even with suspense of disbelief annoyed me greatly and cliches that seemed like lazy writing. \n\n* I'd give it a 7.5 out of 10 \n\nAnd there's my badly formatted thoughts.",

Forrest Gump even has the same score as Interstellar.\n\nBut most importantly, they were hugely ambitious. So ambitious that it becomes the flaw of the movie.\n\nInterstellar is one of those movies. Its ambition is indescribable.\n\nMr. Nolan could have gone for a standard adventure where they spend 20 minutes on each planet with varying special effects landscapes. That would have gotten him the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects for sure.\n\nBut he went further. He went for love, and the heart of what it is to be human.\n\nHe didn't succeed perfectly, but the ambition is incredible.\n\nI watched it twice and I can't wait for my third time.\n\nJust thinking about watching it and watching the relationship between Murph and Coop unfold again makes my heart silently flutter.",

Cooper is popped back out just where he needs to be.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, that is a fine plot for a science fiction movie.  The issue I have with the movie is how we get from plot point to plot point.  For example, Cooper going from a loving father and farmer to deciding to abandon them for an indefinite period of time (potentially forever) was pretty much glossed over.  They explained the situation, said Cooper was the best pilot they had and they needed him to save the race, and boom - he's on board.  It doesn't show him coming to grips with any of that, or show any reason why he would make that choice, it just feels like that was the next plot point, so that's where we were.  \n\nI felt like there were similar situations later on - Cooper needs to get into the black hole, so let's have him jettison his craft into it relatively arbitrarily. I guess the point was that Cooper is now willing to sacrifice himself for humanity's sake - but since when?!  Was it the fight with Matt Damon that caused his change of personality?  Things like this take me out of the movie - just having things arbitrarily happen to go from one plot point to the next.\n\nThe other thing that bugs me about a movie like this is that it plays a bit too loose with science while trying to present a relatively scientific front.  I understand that you need to suspend disbelief, and I'm fine with that.  The fact that going into a black hole allows you to communicate with the past via gravity does not bother me one bit.  I don't know what goes on inside of a black hole, and neither do you.  What does bother me is relaying \"quantum data\" (which is not explained) via Morse code.  I honestly consider that on the same level as \"the neutrinos are mutating\" from 2012.  It's just bullshit science that's used to further the plot.  Just takes me out of the movie.\n\nThe other thing that took me out of the movie, which might not be that big of a deal, is that it felt like the 2001 allusions and homages were almost too strong.  Outside of the visual (black hole scene) and aural (classical music) similarities, the plot just screamed 2001 at me.  Spaceship travels to mysterious object floating around jupiter/saturn.  Takes spaceman on mysterious journey.  Spaceman eventually turns into being that can communicate with the past/move life into the next stage of evolution.  A lot of the same beats.",

This is the question of what first created the worm hole near Saturn.\n\nFor the first iteration there was no worm hole and mankind died out. The robots like TARS and CASE survived and achieved full AI sentience and reproduction.\n\nThe new sentient robotic life form spread through the galaxies over the course of millions of years but always held the human creators alive in their circuits. \n\nEventually the robots ascended to the 5th dimension and missed their original creators. They then determine the optimal time spot to place the worm hole and this started the second iteration.\n\nIn the second iteration the humans go through the worm hole but Cooper is destroyed in the black hole. Amelia starts the new human colony while earth again dies off.\n\nThis time it is humans who evolve across millions of years and eventually ascend to the 5th dimension and again want to bring along their original earth ancestry. This time it is the colony humans who catch Cooper and the events unfold as in the movie.\n\nSince we are dealing with crazy 5th dimension beings it is possible both the 1st iteration robots and 2nd generation colony humans still exist and are waiting for their original earth humans from the 3rd iteration to join them.

Cooper and Brand goes seperate ways at the wormhole, Copper goes in the wormhole and Brand gets flunged to the Edmund planet. Cooper communicates through the bookcase wich proves that \"the equation\" is solvable, 40-something Murph solves it and Cooper gets back to earth as a 124 year old. He meets what looks like a 80-something Murph on the Cooper-station. She tells him that no parent should watch their child dies and tells him to go out and look for Brand. Who she says is probably setting up an base on the Edmund planet which is habitable. Cooper jets off in a ship. \n\nWhy in the world did Murph wait 40 something years to say that to anybody? They knew the location of the Edmund planet and Murph obviously knew something about her being ok or able to live there. And how did she know that it was in fact Brand? She has no knowledge of Miller or any of the others dying. Did she wait to say it for 40 years because she knew that her father was coming back sometime in the future and she knew that he likes to explore stuff? She saying that to Cooper led to her later saing \"Go\", it haunted Cooper the whole film that she said \"stay\" before he left. Cooper going to find Brand will fill the void that was created after his wife died. Murph leaving out the information about Brand being alive on a different planet for so long struck me as a plotpoint to complete Coopers emotional journey, and not something based in logic or natural progression of the story.

The professor just needed time to figure out the gravitational effect to be able to launch such a large ship. I didn't feel cheated at the end because the earlier exposition gave me a clear sense that the gravitational effect itself (the one discovered by Murph, which is different, but perhaps may be related, to the one used by Cooper to move the books) was not going to be explained. The reveal near the end was more about how the gravitational effect was discovered, not how the effect itself works.

Its a fairly complicated plot and a movie that asks serious questions about the human race and Im sure the studio could have made just as much money churning out something alot dumber and less original",

I personally wasn't suspecting the fact that Cooper was the \"Ghost\", it took me completely by surprise. So many great scenes and concepts. The robots were interesting - the scene with Mann had my heart beating - the scientific complications had me wanting to look into it myself when I got home - the emotion had me almost in tears - the score was flipping amazing, Hans Zimmer has outdone himself yet again.\n\nJust everything about this film has me shaking. The moment I left the theatre I took a look at my watch and had a quick shiver, than left the building and looked up at a full moon and star filled sky in wonder.\n\nOne problem I had with the movie was that some scenes dialog were drowned out by the music, and Michael Cain was impossible to understand on his death bed.

If the bookshelf scene was a materialization of space into a physical dimension, and if that 'simulation' was created by us, mankind, it had to be in the future, meaning that space travel to the past would be possible, what could essentially tell us that future mankind was the mankind from another parallel reality saving another mankind. I don't know if i'm making myself clear here, but that's what i got from that scene.\n\nAnother thing that struck me quite a lot was the amount of 'real' and theoretically possible science that was used for this movie. Yes it is a Sci-Fi movie, but the Fi part is much smaller.\n\nJust simply one of the best movies of all time, and certainly a staple in movie history.\n\n",

Everything looked gorgeous, I think it will get an oscar for just that.\n\n\n*I went with a friend who is a scientist, he disliked that the film resolved in a pseudo scientific way.\n\n\n*I however had no problem with the concept of 4th/5th dimensional beings. If your having trouble wrapping your head around it you should read the book Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by  Edwin Abbott Abbott. \n\n*If you were comfortable with those ideas and want more, you should check out The Invisibles by Grant Morrison.  I'm happy that the ideas that these books put forward are leaking out into the general public.\n\n\n*The score was mixed way to loud, I had trouble hearing a good chunk of the dialogue.\n\n\n*I had trouble believing that Dr.Mann wouldn't know about depressurization. I also didn't buy Damon as a genius scientist at all (even if he was good will hunting grown up).\n\n\n*I really liked the look of the miniatures and how the planets looked from space.\n\n\n*The scene when they talk about the textbooks being \"fixed\" made me think the theme of the film was going to be about anti-intellectualism. I almost thought that Cooper would be persecuted for his belief in science.\n\n\n*The only complain I had was that the 5th dimensional beings are unbound by time and space, why didn't they return him to earth before or shortly after they left on the mission. I guess it was nice enough of them to drop him off somewhere he would be found.",

            "body": "To me, this movie was very entertaining and very good film making. Of course a movie on this big of scale (an epic) is going to have massive plot holes in story, and not be 100% scientifically accurate, film making never is. I like how ambitious this movie is. I think the Nolans may just like to rely too much on their obviously well-labored story at times, because Chris Nolan is obviously a very talented director as far as visualization and editing/pacing goes. I just think he gets so wrapped up in his plots, that his character's motivations always fall apart in his movies. I appreciate that he's trying to hone his scripts with his brother so they are presented in a way that seems like every aspect of the script feels equally loved and labored over, and I think thats a great mentality of script writing, but when it becomes an actual movie making process things always have to change in the script for the movie to be made. And I think that Chris Nolan tries so hard to stay completely faithful to every element of his script that he worked on with his brother, he sometimes may fail to balance out all the elements of his script (setting, characters, plot points, etc.) in the directing process. This is by no means a boring movie, when you watch it, it is always visually stimulating. I love how hard Nolan tries, and his ambition and love of film is greatly presented, but I think he has yet to make his best movie, and am excited to see what he does next. Personally, I would like to see Chris Nolan direct movies that aren't his screenplays. He would make an amazing Bond film, maybe even do a Star Wars. I have not fallen in love with this movie yet, but I really did enjoy it and would recommend it to anyone. ",

However, on the second viewing I see now that he tries to get himself to stay FIRST then after realizing that he has to be there, he then goes on to give the NASA coordinates in binary to himself so he can get there.\n\nOther than that it was pretty solid. I felt the music and sound might have been too loud during the spinning dock scene but I now realize that the dialogue in that scene wasn't anything too important. It was just both Cooper and Case and Tars counting down to engine firing, detaching of modules, etc. So nothing of value was lost.\n\nI have to say this might be my favorite movie this year. ",

Instead they somehow came up with the resources and manpower to build other devices which could sustain the life, while mankind was dying?\n\nI might be missing a fundamental piece of the puzzle (ie, that you need gravity to sustain life?), but I don't see why controlling gravity helped the human race grow so much in fifty years when it was on the verge of extinction, when they didn't (or couldn't have) moved everyone to a new planet when there wasn't a new planet in our solar system.",

They explained it all, but I'll try to recap for you:\n\nWhen Cooper first arrives at NASA, he is shown the space shuttles, and he is shown the space station in progress. He tilted his head to the side and saw it for what it was.\n\nFurther along in the movie, it was found out that whats-his-face (the old guy) could only solve part of the equation for harnessing gravity to propel the space station from earth. They needed to connect the known theories of gravity to quantum physics, and the information they needed was in the black hole (readings from the singularity in the black hole). So, when TARS and Cooper fell into the black hole, TARS took readings, and relayed them to Cooper in morse code so that he could program those readings into the watch. That was why the second hand on the watch was moving back and forth in one spot; it was morse code.",

Of course many times I've tried, but the enthusiasm and jubilee of thoughts rarely was reciprocated. At times, it felt lonely... but never the less still enthralling.\n\nAnd to what it seems like an eternity ago, I stumbled across great minds like Steven Hawking, Michio Kaku, Kenneth Miller, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. People who helped quench that thirst and nurtured it to a healthy, humbling, yet self proclaimed understanding interest. It seemed at least in my personal little world, I was being fed the most prolific information of my adult life.\n\nMy quest for knowledge had unknowingly evolved into a quest for my own personal spiritual fulfillment.\n\nFor pretty much most of my life, the odds of me ever experiencing a spiritual awakening that is typically only heard of in religious circles seemed infinitesimally too small. \n\nWhen I walked into to see Interstellar yesterday, I experienced the most beautiful piece of work I've ever seen in cinema. To the average viewer, it may be just another space movie. But this masterpiece struck such a strong chord with me, I felt like it was made for me.  It was as if the writers had tesseract like access to my own thoughts and memories.\n\nI'm a 29 year old man... greatly calloused emotionally. And wept from pure joy at a number of points in the film.  Though my breath was taken away, I felt they gave the emptiness of space an atmosphere for where I felt I could breathe. The awe, the wonder, the absolute captivation of my soul was at play. \n\nInterstellar for me was my \"Nessun Dorma\" opera. The visuals, the story, and perhaps my favorite, the audiography was perfect. Not by oneself, but together in harmony.\n\nMany years ago, I suffered from a temporal lobe seizure that instilled severe panic attacks and a crippling existential crisis that paralyzed me with fear. I experience hallucinatory loops at times that feel as if I'm dying.  It's been a rough road, and very tiresome and taxing.  Finding relief for this has become more and more scarce. However, I've become more scarred and boarded up.  The final act in this film came full circle for me like a loop.  I lost my fucking mind - but this time, for in a good way.  I teared up many times in the movie from just pure joy.  But at this point, it started to feel like something else.  It felt spiritual. Like an awakening. Like if I had a relationship with God and He/She talked back.  A grown, 29 year old man, with PTSD and a calloused tortured soul, was armorless and dare I proclaim pitiful walking into this movie.  At the end of it, I felt like a new person. \n\nI highly doubt I'll ever experience cinema or art the way I did yesterday morning. Nor am I quite sure it'll ever be quite necessary. \n\nStellar is defined as of relating to the stars, or as more commonly down here on our little planet, an adjective for something marvelous, superb, or even heavenly. \n\nAnd of course the prefix of \"inter\" brings one agency to interact with another. \n\nThere's no doubt about it, that on the morning of November 8, 2014, I truly experienced what it is to feel stellar. \n\nAll those years of submerging myself in the awe of the cosmos finally gave me something back.\n\nThank you Interstellar.\n\nTLDR: It blew my fucking mind out of the back of my fucking head. Go see this fucking movie. It's film at its finest.... Excuse me, I meant.. it's film at its fucking finest.\n\n\n",

Murph represents the Son a.k.a Jesus the savior (remember she was 10 years old at start and after 23 years time dilation was 33 when she \u201csaves\u201d the world \u2013 same age as Jesus dies). They both represent the Holy trinity.\n\n4) We have an otherworldly unknown powerful presence who created the wormhole and tessaract that guide the events of the film \u2013 aka Godlike who has have basically interfered with and guided Coop throughout his life going as far as to construct a tesseract for one particular moment in time. God advocates true love and is major theme of film with father and daughter.\n\n5) There were 12 original astronauts sent out onto the planets \u2013 There were 12 apostles of Jesus sent out for his gospel.\n\n6) Cooper also spends decades wandering desolate environments,\"Lazarus\". Dies and is reborn at black hole.\n\n7) Holy Spirit/Ghost Coop reaching out to touch people (including hand shake scene white light)\n\n8) And just like Jesus after his resurrection, he came back (albeit 3 days vs. 70-something years) then left again after a very short period of time.\n\n9) Literal Noah\u2019s Ark with at end with Cooper space station transporting humanity.\n\n10) Adam and Eve with Coop and Brand (embryos for Plan B \u2013 start new race).",

The movie seemingly tries to reel you in with all these algorithms and theories that sound reasonable, then drop these absurd bomb shells that are so out of place...\n\nWhen the black hole turns out to be his daughter's bed room, probably about half the members of the audience laughed...I'm not even joking. \n\nI mean, it's not really a cop-out, yet it feels like one (I know, that doesn't make any sense) the movie does foreshadow it pretty well and on reflection at one point the movie flat out says it early on. But still, it just felt...wrong. \n\nThen again, maybe I went into the movie with the wrong mindset. If you go into this film expecting a bonding film, it's excellent at that. Cooper's reaction after realizing 23 years had gone by was just so powerful that it even had me tear up a bit. Pretty much all the scenes involving Murphy and Cooper are top notch.\n\nBut, there's a lot of time between those scenes, and a LOT of it feels filler. Pretty much every scene on Earth after Cooper leaves it feels VERY tacked on. Until Murphy turns the same age as her father, the whole film is from his perspective, then they decide to switch to her perspective constantly at random moments that to me felt out of place. Like when Cooper is entering the black hole, and then we switch back to Earth for a pretty pointless shot...that just killed the mood for me. \n\nThat being said, there's still some great things in this movie and I definitely would recommend it because a lot of people seem to either love it or dislike it, and you can still find some great things about the film even if you dislike the plot. \n\nBut for me, this is definitely my least favorite Nolan film, however I feel like I need to sit on it a bit. It's 2 a.m and it's only been an hour since I saw it...so maybe I just need to sleep on it. ",

It was the promise to return to his daughter or love that drew him to her bedroom but he was still in the fifth dimension with no way of communicating. That is where gravity comes in. Gravity can transcend space and time. This allowed him to send gravity spikes to her room to communicate. \n\nI thought Nolan did a great job conveying the complexity of a fifth dimension to a two dimensional screen much like how Cooper communicated to Murph.

Because we have genuine responsibilities to future generations.\n\nIt's a stark reminder of our situation today with climate change. We're on a precipice. ",

I dislike the church windpipe in general, that high pitch noise hurts my ears.\n\nPacing is a bit messy. That amazing scene with cooper drove away after murph rejected him, and then the count down, then the lift off, was perfect.\nBut the humor suddenly starts. It came way too early imo. I really wanted to sink in that murph rejection cooper scene.\n\nWhile I like the poem \"Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night\", I didn't like how it was presented. It is powerful enough to just be said once, but it is repeated several times. \nI disliked how it is said out in the scene where we see the ship leaving the Earth, I wish we just had complete silence to fully appreciate the bravery on one tiny ship sent sail far away from the planet home.\n\nTom. I feel Cooper is paying too little attention for him. It's almost weird because he treats murph so much better. I like that Murph is more like him but it still felt kinda weird. it's weird that the ending didn't mention him at all.\nIf the movie is about love, then at least show some love for him too.",

Loved how Zimmer did that. \n\nI could write tons more. This movie was fantastic. I've never cried in the movies. This movie made me. Not because of sadness, but because of pure awe. ",

            "body": "You know, there were a lot of individual moments I liked in this movie, but I seem to be one of the rare posters here who actually thought, overall, that it was bad, and that Nolan's earlier work (Batman Begins, Inception) was much better. Sorry guys, I know you're going to hate me or ignore me for writing this, but hear me out. My impression was honestly that this movie was a lot like Prometheus, in that people were constantly saying and doing things which were confusing or made no sense. Warning, epic nitpicking ahead.\n\n* The Indian Surveillance drone. Didn't the Indian government, like, care that someone stole their airplane? Coop puts it in his truck and we never hear about it again. Makes me feel like they threw this scene in because it sounded cool\u2014and it does\u2014and I know it relates to the gravity well or whatever, but I was like, guys, there will be consequences if you steal a military aircraft, but there weren't, because this was a Movie. Also, wouldn't the American government care that the Indians are flying drones through their airspace...? Shouldn't we maybe at least think about telling the police? And then the school principal is like, I see you've driven up with a fighter plane in your truck, hur hur hur. Is this a regular occurrence for country folk?\n\n* All the crops are dead except corn, and Michael Caine tells us that corn is going to go soon as well. Fast forward, like, several decades, and people are still eating corn, even though I clearly saw that little stalk of corn wilting in the lab!\n\n* Michael Caine appears to be building a giant spaceship out of cement, which made me think immediately of Space Mutiny.\n\n* I liked the crazy science teacher (it does sometimes seem as if these people will inherit the earth, especially after the last midterm elections), I liked the giant tidal wave sequence even though Random Bearded Dude died for no reason, I liked flying through the wormhole, yeah, I liked a lot of things, a lot of images (though all the upside-down landscapes had me thinking that Christopher Nolan likes things that are upside down\u2014they drew me out of the movie), but overall I was like, why can't there just be one cool planet, why do we need three, there's a solar system in another galaxy with three okay planets, and not a single decent planet in our *own* galaxy...?\n\n* People in my theater laughed when Matt Damon woke up and cried. The theater was full and almost everyone was laughing. I almost laughed at the moment where they're like, let's visit *another* crazy relativity planet, and with just one quick look the Black Astronaut is like, guys, I was already up here for twenty-three years, I'm not sure I can do *another* twenty-three...\n\n* The Black Hole. Another cool idea, but my inner scientist was like, come on. Aren't black holes supposed to be...black? Why is it so dark out in space but so bright on all the different planets? How are those planets getting enough heat and light to be warm? Shouldn't they all be frozen? And wouldn't being that close to a black hole destroy those planets anyway? Is the black hole eating a sun or something? And then if you get close to a black hole, don't you Spaghettify...? I didn't like how the movie pretends to embrace science, but modifies it to suit the story as soon as science gets in the way. 2001 didn't do that.\n\n* Have to admit, the robots were cool, but maybe one would have been enough.\n\n* Coop's quick explanation of science to Murph wasn't really sufficient in my opinion...she saw a ghost, she wants to prove it scientifically, then she needs proof. Right now all she has is a broken lunar lander, and that's not really enough. Science is having an idea and then proving it in a way other people can check.\n\n* When Grownup Murph figured out that Coop was, like, the ghost, I was like, HOW? All he was doing was shoving books off of a shelf! Also, in the future, people can transcend space and time and build black holes and wormholes, but they can't communicate with the past in a way that's more effective than shoving books off a shelf? Come on, give me a break. Cool idea to insert Coop into a Borgesian universe, but I didn't buy it for a second. I never doubted the sequence at the end of 2001 because the movie didn't try to explain it: the dude falls into a chasm, sees weird shit, ages and dies in a room with a black monolith as his only companion, and then gets transformed into a giant flying fetus. Is any explanation required?\n\n* Too much crying. Don't push those emotional buttons so much. I'm a [young] father, I have two kids, the only time I felt emotional was when Coop's son holds up his first baby. The audience DID gasp when they got back from the ocean planet, but I wasn't really surprised...they said a lot of time would pass, and a lot of time passed. \n\n* Matt Damon destroyed the spaceship, but then they dock and things are mostly okay inside the same spaceship. What? There was never this problem with Gravity. Once there's a hull breach, your goose is cooked. Also, Matt Damon literally popping up in the middle of your movie will remind people that they are watching a movie.\n\n* I didn't understand Matt Damon's thought process at all. I must kill everyone and steal the spaceship so I can save everyone. I will put myself to sleep forever next to a robot that will explode if anyone tries to access its data. I am an astronaut, but I will open an airlock that is obviously not connected to another airlock. I'm just shaking my head thinking about his character.\n\n* Grownup Murph burning the field. Why? I pissed off my brother, so now I'm going to go outside and set fire to his field, go back inside while That Seventies Show is yelling at me to come out, and then my brother's going to come back from trying to save the last of Earth's food supply, which I have randomly tried to burn down, by the way, and he's not going to care that I'm waving a watch in his face and telling him that I've figured it out.\n\n* Magic Black Hole Data Saves The Equation, so why didn't you just send the robot in to begin with? Also, a robot gets this data from floating around in an infinite tesseract. What sensors does the robot use? How can the robot see anything more than Coop? And then how does Coop, like, grab the watch's second hand? I don't understand the physics of the movie's universe, and I was continually, like, he can push books off a shelf, he can wave his hands in the dust, but he can't spell out a simple message? Also, if every moment in the tesseract was a moment in time, the people should have been frozen through each bookshelf, and he should have had to move past them to make them move, which would have made communication impossible.\n\n* Ann Hathaway is on another planet, and humanity is rebuilding on the other side of the wormhole, and nobody cares about her? Nobody has sent a message telling her help is on the way? It looks like she's been there for awhile...\n\n* Coop meets his daughter, and it's...someone else, the third actress for this character, and she immediately tells him to go away. Alright, movie. I've been searching for this guy my whole life, but as soon as I find him, who cares? Some random lady I barely met seventy years ago is more important.\n\n* NASA can send three astronauts to three different planets, but they can't get decent pictures, they can't send probes back and forth. Is the wormhole a one-way street?\n\n* Why does the wormhole go to another galaxy? Are there no decent planets AT ALL in our own galaxy? Doesn't that seem like a bit of a stretch?\n\n* Why was the wormhole built near Saturn? Why didn't the aliens put it closer to Earth, if they wanted to help?\n\n* Why didn't the aliens / future humans just stop the Blight if they wanted to help? Again, we can build wormholes, but solving a comparatively simpler problem is way, way, way beyond us. A grandfather paradox / time loop is a two-edged sword.\n\n* Murph, Coop, what is up with the names in Nolan's movies?\n\n* I was surprised when the Lander first landed, like the big spaceship. I was like, wait, they have another spaceship? Where did that come from...?\n\n* Corn is all we've got, but I'm going to just drive my truck straight through it for a robot airplane we never see again.\n\n* Cars haven't changed for a hundred years (and I've been driving the same pickup through like hourly dust storms for how many decades now?), but spaceships and robots are way more advanced.\n\n* NASA is building spaceships which require thousands and thousands of personnel, and sending them to other galaxies, and yet the entire world doesn't know (but Coop somehow knows about the Lazarus Missions).\n\n* NASA has their last spaceship ready to go, but they don't have a pilot, and then Coop shows up, and they're like, hey, you'd be perfect for this job!, how convenient!, and the weird wormhole aliens sent you here, no questions asked. Lots of very, very, very fortunate coincidences going on here...\n\n* If the planets are orbiting the black hole at relativistic speeds, there's no way a spaceship could land on them, and I think the planets would be torn apart...?\n\n* My issue isn't with the filmmaking or the acting (Ann Hathaway was annoying and seemed like she didn't know what she was doing in the beginning, but later on she was okay / the images were frequently very cool), just the (as usual with Nolan) needlessly complicated plot. This would have been a cooler movie: things are falling apart on Earth, mankind discovers a wormhole near Saturn (no idea why it's there), sends a ship through, finds a planet on the other side, but they discover they can only go one way, so they have to use artificial insemination to restart the species.\n\n* Koyaanisqatsi + 2001 = Hans Zimmer soundtrack. \n\n* Let's build a museum, and fill it with loud televisions.\n\n* Random poem from a dude who has never expressed interest in poetry.\n\nThat's all the nitpicking I've got for now. One of my babies is crying, so I've got to go...",

Fast forward, like, several decades, and people are still eating corn, even though I clearly saw that little stalk of corn wilting in the lab!\n\nSimple, he lied about how fast it would happen that to further motivate Cooper to leave quickly. He's lied about other things, after all.\n\n> Michael Caine appears to be building a giant spaceship out of cement, which made me think immediately of Space Mutiny.\n\n?\n\n> I was like, why can't there just be one cool planet, why do we need three, there's a solar system in another galaxy with three okay planets, and not a single decent planet in our own galaxy...?\n\nIt takes a very long time to go anywhere out of our solar system, far longer than cryosleep can keep you alive for (thousands of years). The wormhole's exit destination ended up being close enough to visit 12 planets within the cryosleep's limits.\n\n> People in my theater laughed when Matt Damon woke up and cried. \n\nI think people were laughing that it was Matt Damon, it seems to have been a well kept secret.\n\n> The Black Hole. \n\nWhile there was a black hole at the center of that thing, that entire thing was not a black hole. They obviously embellished the graphics for it, but I think the outer part of it was just to show where the time dilation effect extended to.\n\n> Have to admit, the robots were cool, but maybe one would have been enough.\n\nThey are cool.\n\n> Too much crying. Don't push those emotional buttons so much. I'm a [young] father, I have two kids, the only time I felt emotional was when Coop's son holds up his first baby. The audience DID gasp when they got back from the ocean planet, but I wasn't really surprised...they said a lot of time would pass, and a lot of time passed.\n\nAs a sci-fi nut, I knew exactly what was going to happen - but I think most people glossed over the time dilation explanation they gave (when I come back, I might be the same age as you) and then the further hints where they pretty much said \"1 hour will be 7 years\" (which is almost directly lifted from Inception). I'm not sure how Nolan could explain it better, it was a problem a lot of people had with Inception.\n\n> Matt Damon destroyed the spaceship, but then they dock and things are mostly okay inside the same spaceship. What? There was never this problem with Gravity. Once there's a hull breach, your goose is cooked.\n\nIt looked like they docked in different places. I might be wrong about this, but it seemed like a different part of the orbital station was destroyed and not the central dock in the middle.\n\n> I didn't understand Matt Damon's thought process at all.\n\nI think the main thing about Matt Damon's character is that deep down he was a coward, despite being labelled as humanity's greatest person. So what he was doing wasn't to save anyone's life, that was just an excuse, he was just trying to save himself. The movie doesn't really mention this, but my theory is that being in cryosleep too long is not a good thing for you, but they don't imply this anywhere else so maybe that's not true.\n\n> Grownup Murph burning the field. Why? I pissed off my brother, so now I'm going to go outside and set fire to his field, go back inside while That Seventies Show is yelling at me to come out, and then my brother's going to come back from trying to save the last of Earth's food supply, which I have randomly tried to burn down, by the way, and he's not going to care that I'm waving a watch in his face and telling him that I've figured it out.\n\nShe did that to force her brother to take his family and leave. It worked. She didn't realize at the time that she was going to figure out the mystery of her ghost during that time.\n\n> Magic Black Hole Data Saves The Equation. And then how does Coop, like, grab the watch's second hand? I don't understand the physics of the movie's universe, and I was continually, like, he can push books off a shelf, he can wave his hands in the dust, but he can't spell out a simple message? Also, if every moment in the tesseract was a moment in time, the people should have been frozen through each bookshelf, and he should have had to move past them to make them move, which would have made communication impossible.\n\nHe wasn't actually manipulating objects in time, he was affecting gravity. He could only do crude things at first, but eventually he figured out how to affect the watch's second hand. Since he was in a timeless state, I guess we don't really know how long he was up there (or if time even matters).\n\n> Ann Hathaway is on another planet, and humanity is rebuilding on the other side of the wormhole, and nobody cares about her? Nobody has sent a message telling her help is on the way? It looks like she's been there for awhile...\n\nFeels like they got comfortable in their space station and couldn't find anyone to take that risk? Someone like Cooper...\n\n> Coop meets his daughter, and it's...someone else, the third actress for this character, and she immediately tells him to go away. Alright, movie. I've been searching for this guy my whole life, but as soon as I find him, who cares? Some random lady I barely met seventy years ago is more important.\n\nShe was dead anyway and she had an attachment to him as her father and only wanted him to fulfill his promise, but ultimately, she had long gotten past him as being a major figure in her life. Then she gave him a new purpose, to save Dr. Brand (and she probably figured he needed some nooky after 70 years).\n\n> NASA can send three astronauts to three different planets, but they can't get decent pictures, they can't send probes back and forth. Is the wormhole a one-way street?\n\nIt sounds like it, as soon as they went across, they got the data that was cached on the other side that didn't seem to come back.\n\n> Why does the wormhole go to another galaxy? Are there no decent planets AT ALL in our own galaxy? Doesn't that seem like a bit of a stretch?\n\nYou're repeating yourself :) There's no planets in our galaxy that are anywhere near close enough to reach within the limits of cryosleep. The wormhole was in a place that was reachable (Saturn) and ended up in a location that was close enough to 12 feasible locations.\n\n> Why was the wormhole built near Saturn? Why didn't the aliens put it closer to Earth, if they wanted to help?\n\nThe aliens were future evolved humans. I'm going to guess they tried to get it as close to Earth as possible and on a cosmic scale, it's like they reached 1 inch from the golf hole from a 1000 yard putt. It was already damn impressive to get it in the right solar system.\n\n> Why didn't the aliens just stop the Blight if they wanted to help? Again, we can build wormholes, but solving a comparatively simpler problem is way, way, way beyond us.\n\nThe world was tapped out. Even if they fixed the blight, the dirt literally could not grow any more crops. The moral point of the story was that humans screwed up the earth and had to leave it. The future humans (the \"they\", there are no aliens involved) could only exist if humans left the earth and the \"quantum data\" being given to Murph helped to achieve that goal.\n\n> I was surprised when the Lander first landed, like the big spaceship. I was like, wait, they have another spaceship? Where did that come from...?\n\nThere was already a Ranger on the orbital station already and they arrived in the second Ranger.\n\n> Corn is all we've got, but I'm going to just drive my truck straight through it for a robot airplane we never see again.\n\nThe drone's power supply would have allowed them to power the farm for another 10 years, so it was either figure out a way to scrape energy without it or get it and sacrifice a few crops.\n\n> Cars haven't changed for a hundred years (and I've been driving the same pickup through like hourly dust storms for how many decades now?), but spaceships and robots are way more advanced.\n\nRemember that almost everything that wasn't directly related to farming was stopped or thought to be stopped. So nobody was innovating on cars because whoever was left of the world was focusing on better agriculture. But space research continued in secret because some elements in the government thought leaving the planet might be the only option.\n\n> NASA is building spaceships which require thousands and thousands of personnel, and sending them to other galaxies, and yet the entire world doesn't know (but Coop somehow knows about the Lazarus Missions).\n\nCooper was part of the Lazarus mission indirectly, he was being trained to fly the Ranger space craft before he crashed (that's what the first scene is showing us, that he suffered a crash and then lost contact with NASA when he thought it was shut down).\n\n> NASA has their last spaceship ready to go, but they don't have a pilot, and then Coop shows up, and they're like, hey, you'd be perfect for this job!, and the weird wormhole aliens sent you here, no questions asked. Lots of very, very, very fortunate coincidences going on here...\n\nNot really a coincidence, he was trained for this mission long ago, he crashed and I guess NASA wrote him off. Remember that Cooper recognized Dr. Brand's name but knew it wasn't an (attractive) woman's name. He realizes his mistake when he meets the older Dr. Brand.\n\n> If the planets are orbiting the black hole at relativistic speeds, there's no way a spaceship could land on them, and I think the planets would be torn apart...?\n\nI'm not sure how fast they are going, but it didn't seem to be a very smooth landing but the spaceships are, as you mentioned, much more advanced than what we are used to.\n",

            "body": "Since it will be ignored on imdb, I'll write my review here **[SPOILERS]** (the movie is awesome):\n\nI just came from watching it, and honestly, I'd pay $50 for the ticket, and then watch it again! I intentionally never saw any trailers or posters or informed myself of anything about the movie, except for that main picture that is on imdb.\nInterstellar is an SF drama and yes, adventure. Seeing as it's a Nolan movie, I had very high expectations of it and indeed, I was not disappointed. I was a bit skeptical for seeing Matthew McConaughey as a lead role because he's always too cowboy-ish, but hey, it's a Nolan movie, therefore it must be good! And it was. He has done his job as expected, and was brilliant in some scenes. Anne Hathaway has also performed flawlessly, as expected, despite my liking of her. I was also surprised to see Matt Damon despite thinking there'd be a corpse instead of him. Also, amazing performance. I didn't think he'd play that kind of character though. Nevertheless, pleasantly surprised. Visuals are stunning, soundtrack was a bit louder than expected, but it adds to the movie, especially with that silence of the space for contrast. There was also a scene where there was a transition from the space to atmosphere due to door opening and you hear the sound fading in as the air reaches the listener (the camera, right). It was a short, but very satisfying detail. And that graze of that ice cloud... great detail!\n\nThe script. The script was nothing less than perfect and absolutely original. That is all there is to say about it. It's complex where it needs to be, simple when it is required. Humor was perfectly dosed and administered exactly when it needed to be. Drama is present through most of the movie and SF is not really present at the beginning. That kinda depends on how you look at that stage of humanity. And the way the unexplainable things happen and you just forget about it, and then at the end the story explains itself and unfolds is absolutely flawless. Of course, there had to be a touch of imagination for the story to succeed like that, like what will he find inside the black hole. Instead of spaghettification, he ends up behind his daughter's bookshelf being her ghost. Notice that she said she was never afraid of the ghost because it seemed like a person to her.\n\nThere was a 15 minute pause in the middle of the movie (just when Hathaway recites (or hears) the \"Do not go gentle into that good night\") and there were three guys commenting how it's an alright movie, but there's a lot of that \"emotional father-daughter crap\". What the hell people? It's not an action movie! It's a drama. Go watch Transformers for SF action. You don't go watching a movie like this expecting shootings and explosions! Dammit!\n\nFinally, the movie speaks about love being something we can not understand **yet**. And that *it* is a spaceless and timeless - thing. Hathaway and McConaughey have a dialog on that. Very well thought.\n\nFinally finally, there were movies that had besieged me in their story, like The Dark Knight or Cloud Atlas, but this; Interstellar had sucked me in so much that at the moment I was in another galaxy in a spaceship watching 23 years of video messages from my growing son and my daughter. Also, that time dilation - mind blowing!\n\nEDIT: Rating 10/10 and all other movies -1.\n2ndEDIT: Rotten tomatoes, Metacritic, why such low scores? THAT is not valid.",

            "body": " The Good:\n\n1. Matthew McConaughey . My god can this man turn hokey dialogue around. His choices were good. His range in this film is good. All in all he swung for the fences and knocked it out of the park, into a wormhole, around a blackhole and right into a 2nd Best Actor nom.\n\n2. The visuals were perfect. I don't think they could get any better for a modern film going for realism. The CGI was not heavy handed, just like Inception, and the conventional effects were superb. Just in terms of tech it has to be the most believable spaceship put on a movie. Even in the typical Nolan world of muted colors there were some stand-out shots that really felt portrait-esque.\n\n3. The robots were bro-tier comfy. I was waiting for a 2001 twist where the robots betray humanity but the twist never came. IT NEVER CAME. Matty McCool is going to have a robot bro for life now.\n\n4. The emotion. This is probably the most emotional movie Nolan has made. Most of his other films are far too emotionally distant but this one actually tugged at my feels. The characters were able to admit mistakes instead of blindly flying into a hubris filled rage like the crew on Prometheus. And watching the 22 years of transmissions was so heart-wrenching. Anne Hathaway nailed it when she said she had no idea how it really feel.\n\nThe Bad.\n\n1. This is the worst edited AAA+ movie I have seen in theaters in a long time. There are Youtube TV series that are better put together than this film. Nothing felt fluid. It's like the movie was a flight of stairs and we were pushed down and every time our face hit the ground it was a scene. Even some scenes appeared to be cut short because the run-time was atrociously lengthy.\n\n2. God awful dialog. I mean terrible. Unforgivable almost. If it wasn't hokey it was tedious exposition. And exposition nullifies any magic of acting choices. Instead of showing us something through acting choices they tell us with semi-narration. If the robot wasn't in the tesseract scene would Rust have just been talking to himself?\n\n3. Matt Damon. I like Matt Damon as a person. They could've cut his entire scene out of the movie and saved us a bunch of trouble. It was a nice idea, but his only purpose was dramatic tension and he did nothing to set back anything. Which is surprising because I thought that Ghost dad would be the worst part of this movie.\n\n4. The try-hard film of the year. I had a really good time watching this movie but when it was over I was like \"wait a minute, what's going on here\". The themes were empty. There was a lot of 'I am very smart' things going on in this movie. And if I see one more movie explain a wormhole by drawing an X on the top and bottom of the paper, saying a strait line is too long, and then they magically fold the paper and then poke a hole through the two Xs to explain how wormholes work it'll be too soon. But then again that ties into my grip about expository narration.\n\nThis is no masterpiece. It had a 2001 feel to it, was slightly better paced, but it was not nearly as awe-inspiring. 5/10 for the story. 10/10 for visuals. Puts us right at an even 7.5/10 overall. I'd say it's as good as Inception, and 2nd place behind The Prestige (which is his best film) and a decent peace offering for the disaster which was TDKR. Nolan painted a nice picture with this movie but unfortunately there were a lot of good ideas but not one of them managed to get fleshed out enough to become interesting.",

They are going with nothing but hope and goodness on a mission to save mankind, Matt Damon is the personification that no matter where you are Evil will always be there. The whole reason why they went down to his planet was because he sent false data that seemed promising.\n\nWhy? Because he knew he was gonna die and he found this to be the only way for him to survive, by faking data, being rescued, killing the people that rescue him and completing the mission so he would be seen as a hero and get to live.

I get this from the Bible (which this movie has a lot of references to). Adam/mankind in Genesis is made by God forming the \"dust of the earth\" and breathing his spirit into it. \"Adamah\" in Hebrew means \"ground/dirt/earth\" and \"Adam\" is taken from \"**Adam**ah\". The movie never really tells what's causing the dust storms other than it's just happening (probably due to global warming but they don't say; we're just to accept it) and I took this to mean symbolically we are our biggest problem while at the same time being our biggest solution.\n\nI think Mann and professor Brand (Cain's character) symbolize man's evil but in different ways; they both had \"good\" intentions, even thought they were doing the right thing, but nevertheless gave up on mankind and lied to their fellow man. \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\". With all the Biblical references (Lazarus mission, 12 astronauts/probes & 1 Judas, Noah's Ark and the cryogenic embryos, parting of black-hole = parting of Red Sea), I was getting some Cain/Abel vibe going on between the 2 characters.",

I get that not everybody in the audience knows what a wormhole is or know what time dilation is but the explanations were just too dumbed down and it was a bit cringe worthy. He didn't do that in the Prestige. He let the audience figure it out for themselves and I appreciated that. \n\n\nRegardless, that's one minor gripe of what was a fantastic movie. ",

The vistas are magnificent, and the research and sfx teams definitely did a fantastic job.\n\nI have one major problem with this movie though, and I think this opinion is fairly common among critics, since the current RT rating is 71%.\n\n[Spoilers](#s \"At the end, after the climactic confrontation with Matt Damon's character (which was actually a surprising appearance) Cooper sacrifices himself to save Amelia and falls into the Black Hole. Rather than being torn apart by the massive amount of gravity, he survives, and enters a 'five dimensional space' where he is able to manipulate time and space within a specific area (that being his daughter's room) From here, he sends both the 'stay' message from the beginning with the books, and the coordinates to the NASA base, before ending it with a weird morse code manipulation of the watch he gave his daughter (how he is able to do all these things quite easily in this space is beyond me) before leaving the 5D space, shaking Past-Amelia's hand as they were going through the wormhole, and ends up back near Saturn, where by some 1 in a quintillion chance is picked up by rangers and survives. The reason I have a problem with this, beyond it not really explaining how the wormhole ended up there in the first place, is that it almost completely negates the entire 'realism' angle the rest of the film had. Pretty much everything had a dirty, gritty look to it (the Cryostasis chamber looked like a public bathroom with its dirty tile floor) which was great, but when he ended up in the 5D room, I immediately realized why this is currently his lowest ranking film on RT (at least out of the ones he directed) It honestly seemed like a half-assed attempt to do a rushed 'explain everything' ending with a little bit of 'forced happy ending' on top. But whatever. That's just me. Everyone else seems to be fine with the ending.\")",

I mean, it would really highlight the theme that human's are more worried about self-preservation than species-preservation. Furthermore, Matt Damon had already alluded to that about 30 minutes before. I also kinda wanted it to end there because I have a love for movies ending with the main characters defeated.\")\n\n\n[Black Hole Finish](#s \"When Cooper went into the black hole, I, again, thought that would be a perfect ending. I mean, Matt Damon had dialog just before about how humans think about their children before they die, and long behold, when Cooper is in the black hole, he is thinking of his children. If the movie had ended when the block hole room collapsed, it would have allowed for a more ambiguous ending.\")",

I am really hoping that someone out there possibly caught the answers I might have missed in the film.\n1) Old dying Murph told Cooper to go out there and find/save Amelia, who was starting a colony of people all by herself on the third planet. Why didn't Murph or some other people from her colony go out there themselves to save her or find her?\n\n\n2) We are to understand that \"They\" is actually us from some time in the distant future. But to me \"They\" is kind of a chicken/egg scenario. Is the presence of a \"They\" in the future guiding us to wormholes and building Tesseracts dependent on Cooper and Murph communicating and making sure humans leave earth? If so, then what the heck. How could \"They\" exist if humans couldn't solve the gravity problem without their future help? Or...\n\n\n3) Was Amelia successful in raising up a new generation on her planet? Was this possibly the human bloodline that became the \"They\" to build the Tesseract so the 21st century human race stuck on earth could survive?",

I understand Cooper was the 'ghost' and was communicating across time and space, but he says there is no 'they' but that cant be true because then who brought him to that '5th dimension' and let him be able to see time linearly?\n\n2. Who opened the worm hole? I know Cooper was communicating with Murph but it didn't explain how the worm hole was opened, so there had to have been another life form aka 'they' that opened it for them\n\n3. Why would Cooper steal the ship at the end to go to Brand, if \"Cooper Station\" was already heading there in the first place? or was that just a space station from which they would launch expeditions to the new human planet that Brand found?\n\nAll I have to say is TEMPORAL CAUSALITY",

            "body": "Well, Nolan has done it again. A short, sweet, TL;DR review for this film from me would be **The Prestige, Inception, and Gravity** have a baby in space. I'm still trying to grasp the events that happened in this film, especially the final few scenes after Cooper ejects. I actually think at that point, the suspension of belief officially kicked in and my mind was blown to pieces. The fact that... *[I just feel that this part has to be put in a spoiler text](#s \"this movie didn't have any aliens in it, which probably would have made it seem like some M. NIGHT SHAMALAMADINGDONG TWIST,\")* ...made it all the more better. \n\nThe pacing seemed off at first since, but I guess Nolan really wanted to get into space as fast as possible due to what was coming next. If you really think about it, it was probably meant to go fast due to how the mission was going to be scheduled. It was interesting how you only got to see just a snippet of one area of the Earth when you contrasted it with the astronauts. The way that principal's helper or whoever described how kids in the coming decades were going to learn that the space missions were fake made me think that pretty much the world wasn't worth saving if there was such a view against space missions. The brother in the family's attitude wasn't helping it, and I thought he was going to cost him and the whole world by smashing that watch that was being shoved into his face by his sister. I bet Nolan has some alternate ending where this is the outcome and Cooper is forever in that fifth dimension. I guess I wanted to see more of what was going on in Earth besides that one area they focused on, but that probably would have taken away some things from the movie and made it into something like Armageddon. \n\nMatt was fucking solid in this film. My joke impression of this film being a sequel to True Detective where Rust goes in space kind of felt true, especially the whole **time is a flat circle** aspect. I honestly couldn't have seen Bale or DiCaprio in that role, but if I had to choose between the two, it would probably be Bale. Michael Caine was typical Nolan-esque Michael Caine, but with somewhat of a twist in this role, especially towards the end of his character's death. Chastain and the little girl who both portrayed Cooper's daughter were great. The black astronaut was pretty cool and I felt pretty sad for him when he had to wait 23 years just for his fellow astronauts to come back in an hour or so that *they* were experiencing. Anne Hatheway's character Brand was interesting, and she really had some pretty emotional moments. TARS was epic. Never thought I'd get so much humor out of a robot.\n\nLast year, **Gravity** made me afraid of thinking about wanting to venture into space just to even chill in the ISS, but this year with **Interstellar** reignited those childhood dreams of being an astronaut and exploring the vast parts of our universe, possibly doing something similar to what this crew did in the movie. I'm pretty sure going through a wormhole, if such a thing is even possible, would be a sight to see, even if it meant dying in the process.\n\nIf I were to rate this movie, it'd be an 8.3/10. If you're a Nolan fan (or really just loved The Prestige or Inception), a space fanatic, an astrophysicist, or a person who's a fan of sci-fi, you'll probably love this film, and I really recommend it.",

In almost every interview you see Nolan in addressing this film he always brings up 2001 Space Odyssey and what a heavy impact it had on him as a kid and I found two things it this that builds on or at least address Kubrick's work. \n\n1. In 2001 the rectangular rock signifies humans evolution (one scene of it with the apes evolving to what is later man and the other in the last scene where man turns into a starchildish thing) \n\n2. That humans are starting to use a new type of intelligence Hal (the talking computer) and how much reliance in computers is appropriate.\n\nI found these significant because the computers Nolan uses is in the same shape and color as the rectangular rock in 2001. I feel for a movie that had such a influence on his childhood that it was more than a coincidence and I'm still trying to figure it. Come on that's an odd shape for a computer. \n\nNolan uses these similarities to address Kubrick's masterpiece. As Kubrick left the idea to be aware of our technology 50 years ago maybe now Nolan is trying to leave the message for the next 50 that our earth is a living thing and it needs to be taken care of? I don't know, what do you guys think?",

They look eerily familiar to Rama, from [Rendezvous with Rama](http://hundredbooksayear.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Spacecolony3edit.jpeg). Yes the refrences to 2001 are made abundently clear, and are easiest to notice, but i think this film is a homage to Arthur C. Clarke, and maybe even sci-fi in general.",

Nonetheless I really appreciate this movie because it's a lot warmer than the others from Nolan (all the family storyline was very touching).\nIt starts real slow, but after they start the interstellar trip it speeds up and the conclusion comes real quick (but afterall it all could've been done with 30 minute less).\nWhat I really didn't like was the final, where there some things that, imho, doesn't  merge very well with the rest of the movie.\nAnyhow, I don't think this is the best Nolan's movie.
