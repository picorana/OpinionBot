Poe's Law is the idea that when an extreme idea is written down, without a smiley or other indication of the author's intent, it's impossible to tell if the author actually believes the extreme idea or is being sarcastic. \n\nSo the parent comment here said they are hoping Trump is actually the biggest troll ever. And some of the crazy things that Trump has said really do seem to be on that line of \"Are you serious or are you being a parody of people who believe that?\" And that's why he seems like an actual physical version Poe's Law. \n",

I think the only kind of Trump supporters you hear about are the red necks and the 'brash' ones who don't care about speaking their mind. However, there were obviously more than everyone thought. I think I heard a news reporter say that one of Clinton's biggest mistakes was calling Trump supporters 'deplorables' - since that would resonate with many who don't identify as such. They also said that he had so many supporters because he had promised change and they had seen that there needed to be changed. It's a lot more complex than just stating \"trump is a misogynist\".

Their goal was to get Trump elected and they are doing their job. I'm mad at the fucking Democrats. You know why?\n\n> Because [every1](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-donald/) [single2](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_sanders-5565.html) [fucking3](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/why-does-sanders-do-better-clinton-against-trump) [poll4](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-general-election-trump-vs-sanders) showed Clinton neck and neck with trump and Bernie out way ahead. Clinton isn't losing because she's a democrat, she's losing because a lot of her actions have been dishonest and people don't trust her. \n\n> That's where Sanders has the big advantage. Even many Clinton supporters admit that they don't like her but they are only voting for her because they like Trump less. What a glowing endorsement. That's why Bernie was a better candidate but the Democrats had to have their queen and now they reap what they sow. Now I know many people will argue that since Clinton > Sanders and Trump > Clinton that means that Trump > Sanders. This is incorrect thinking for a number of reasons. \n\n> Clinton was able to win the primary because she controlled the liberal leaning media and because the Democratic party worked against Bernie Sanders during the primary. \n\n> CNN, MSNBC, NY Times and many liberal comedic pundits were very much biased towards her. This can have a profound impact on a race and drive many supporters away from Sanders to Clinton (even if they didn't like her).\n\n> CNN was mocked as the Clinton News Network because of how biased they were against Sanders and many \"comedic\" pundits like Samantha Bee, Seth Meyers, and others were quick to bash Bernie and his supporters while ignoring the flaws in Clinton. Bernie Bros spread like wildfire even though the Bernie camp had more women in it than the Clinton camp. Clinton also adopted similar language to what Bernie Sanders was saying in order to woo Bernie supporters away from him. So, while they didn't rig the electoral ballot, they sure put all their effort into crushing Bernie's movement instead of trying to understand why Bernie was getting so much support. After he lost Clinton went back to business as usual and Trump catered to Bernie's supporters and tried to woo them.\n\n\n> But wait, if it's true that Clinton controlled so many media outlets and tv shows then why is she losing (maybe did lose depending on time of reading)? By your logic, she should be crushing Trump. Here, lies the biggest flaw in the Democrats plan. They could influence many liberal leaning networks to show Clinton favoritism but Republicans don't watch those shows. A hard core Republican doesn't care about what Samantha Bee has to say. They don't care about MSNBC. So that magical lead that Clinton could force over Sanders (barely) wasn't there against Trump. And the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party worked so hard to trivialize Sanders' supporters ended up biting them in the ass as many did not want to come out and support her. You want to mock and trivialize me so much? Fine, now you get your wish, I am non-existent in this race. \n\n> To put it simply, the Democrats misread the situation and didn't realize the anger boiling up against the establishment. The second they won the primary they shifted tactics to wooing Republicans rather than sticking to Sanders' message because it never occurred to them that Sanders' supporters wouldn't want Hillary. They assumed that Sanders' supporters would just fall in line (like in races before).\n\n\n> So, yeah, Fuck CNN, Fuck the Democrats, and Fuck the new wave of shitty late night comedic pundits. They are cancerous fucks who did everything they could to push out a populist candidate and elect their hated candidate. They deserve what they got.\n\n\n> P.S. Everyone who thinks that this race was decided by Comey's letter about the email investigation being reopened is probably wrong. That was released too close the election time to sink in. Most Republicans will feel vindicated (but they're not voting for Hillary anyway) while most Democrats will feel distrustful of the letter. He released it right next to the election time. This is probably a setup to crush Hillary. I won't fall for it. So, yeah, I doubt it had much effect on the election but it will most likely still be a scapegoat for the loss (instead of researching the real reasons).\n\nEDIT: Link to where I saw it from: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5byarw/selfmeta_i_have_no_dog_in_the_fight_but_let_this/d9sd49p/?st=ivamy8r5&sh=7d6b740a\n\n",

As much as there's a cynical, bitter part of me that's imagining the Trump supporters realizing how stupid they were after Trump becomes exactly what I thought he would be and enjoying the image of him getting destroyed in 2020, I'd rather have 4 years of a decent president than a complete disaster that we have to desperately try to recover from next year.\n\nUltimately, not much to do now but wait and see what happens, and hope it's not the doomsday scenario many predicted.",

But it's so much more than simply being a problem with other people being idiots, and ourselves being blameless. Both parties and even the \"Corporate Media\" we always hear so much about have severely underestimated the anger and resentment Americans feel right now. This is not about any specific problems, but at the idea of events like, for example, a Democratic Party deciding people will fall in line and vote for their candidate simply because they're not as bad as \"that guy\", or that the Republican Party would continuously try to drop taxes on the wealthy and block social reforms Americans seem to feel strongly about, among other, possibly more egregious transgressions by both sides.\n\nThis election isn't about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This election has been about which party tapped into that anger better. The Democrats had a candidate that people felt understood their anger, and the Republicans eventually were pushed into nominating theirs, but the forces acting upon both parties are no different. For just a second, forget the platforms that are, in fact, more important than anything else. Don't forget that the Republicans had to be strong-armed into nominating Donald, just as the Democrats fought against nominating Bernie. On both sides, people are fighting to change the status quo and fighting to keep it. People feel they have been played as pawns; Therefore, they wish to provide the checkmate. If you are wondering how this possibly could have happened, it's because in the course of history the wrath of the people will always be answered, whether it be peacefully, militarily, culturally, or in some other way. This wrath has been created through a underestimating of the people, a dismissal of them, a belief that they can be controlled and will follow like a puppy to its master. We can only hope the wrath is answered favorably.",

Isn't it a problem when your president runs on a platform that seems impossible to implement?\n\nSecond, and more seriously, is Trump still planning to deport ~12 million people? Is the plan for that still deportation squads? \n\nThird, has Trump said whether his plan for ISIS involves missiles, or boots on the ground, or anything like that? I've only heard \"we're going to take them out and then get out\". Which leads me to:\n\nFourth, does Trump plan to do ANYTHING in terms of the stability of Iraq, and how does he feel about Assad and the situation in Syria in general? \n\nLastly, has Trump refined his view on global warming so that it's no longer a Chinese hoax? Or is he still going on with that stuff? Like, even if you're the type to not think that global warming is caused by man, that's at least more understandable than saying it was all a ruse made up by the Chinese...",

And yet, those three candidates would hold the highest office in the land within an election cycle. This strategy is so sound that it even happened in the GOP convention with Ronald Reagan in 1976.\n\nBy comparison, establishment candidates -- such Gore, Kerry and Hillary -- come off as too elitist for middle America.\n\nThere may be some junior senator or little-known state governor buried deep in the speech list at the 2016 Democratic National Convention who might be up for the job. It unfortunately can't be a woman unless she's a successful governor of a conservative state like Texas, Kansas or Georgia. Shitty as it is, it most likely needs to be a little-known-but-successful male governor or senator from the midwest.",

It amazes me how much words like racist, misogynist, homophobic, etc. are being thrown around completely ineffectually, both now and during the election. This, to me, signifies that the impact of those words has decreased significantly, that they are losing their power completely. I don't welcome that. It's a change brought about by those words being abused to the point of meaninglessness. Somewhere along the line, it was discovered that those words have power over others, that they can be used to make empathetic individuals do what you want, in order to avoid being labeled with them.\n\nTrump is a result of that abuse. His campaign only grew stronger as people started throwing slurs at him and his followers. Instead of engaging them, and explaining one's position to them, many simply chose to yell incoherently at them, to cry wolf as it has been done for so long now. And I know that there are many who will say that those people don't deserve to be treated with kindness and debated with. That they're bigots and their minds won't change, and blah blah blah. What those people don't realise is that their mindset is exactly why Trump is president now. And until it changes, until people are capable of starting a dialogue instead of spouting rhetoric and slurs, the sentiment that caused him to win this election will linger and grow stronger.\n\nSo I hope, for all of our sakes, that this particular brand of zealotry will soon end.",

An administration that's basically said they didn't need us to win the white house back. What that breeds is anger, and that anger resulted in supporting an outsider candidate because voting for the establishment was not an option they would partake in.\n\nFrom /u/apleima2",

And it's going be fucking this.\n\nYes, we just put a man in charge of the Executive Branch of our government as well as acting President of our country. An absolutely deranged and demented man, but nonetheless he is now in power. And with that, a conservative republican Senate and House of Representatives. \n\nBut Americans of reddit, this is not the time to kick ourselves in the ass and call it a day for this election cycle. The hate, anger, regret, or downright just blind rage any of you must be feeling will be there, but we **must** take it and turn it into passion. In the next four years, we will have chances to now take a critical eye to our Legislative Branch and vote with a much clearer head. \n\nWe've gotten so caught up with the need to choose one side or the other that we've mixed out branches of government up, thinking that one man or woman in a seat somewhere on the east coast can suddenly change decades of laws that have been passed by the many people of the United States Congress and House of Representatives. So now, open up a tab and start looking into the names of your new or re-elected senators. Form opinions of them, keep an eye on who will have a campaign going when the seasons starts up.\n\nAnd for christ's sake, people, **FUCKING VOTE.** IN EVERYTHING. Not just one election that happens every FOUR YEARS. Vote for your school boards, vote for your mayors, vote for whether or not you want red, green, or blue. JUST VOTE. Because those smaller votes, and the people you put in power, will begin to shape the higher tiers of government. You think Trump will ban gay marriage? That's up to the senate. Our school funding? Senate. Who's going to war? Senate. Toilet paper topside or bottom? SENATE. \n\nSo yea, rage against the dying light and all that business. And do it with a clear, informed mind and steady hand. Don't jump onto a party because you have to. Jump on a party because you AGREE to. And never think the towel's turned in.",

I simply can't believe he won. I'm scared that this will embolden racists to take action against minorities. I'm scared we'll see an increase in gay-bashing. I'm scared that more women will be harassed at clinics, and that doctors will be threatened.\n\nIf his speech tonight is more indicative of his presidency than his campaign has been, I'm more hopeful. But I'm still very very nervous.\n",

Rather than going with the popular and well liked candidate the DNC instead forced a very disliked and openly corrupt (especially in light of the numerous email leaks) candidate on everyone. It was a horrible choice and we have all paid the price for it. \n\nThe truth is Hillary was just a bad candidate. She's untrustworthy. Comes off greedy and power hungry. More importantly she suffers from one of the biggest problem Romney suffered from, she acts like she deserved it; and hardly anyone thought she did. More people paid attention to the emails that wikileaks was dropping as well, and they did not paint a pretty picture. She and the DNC rigged the game, people knew it. She created all these problems, and were all going to pay for them. \n\nSo congrats Hillary and all those that supported and ignored her obvious flaws and corruption's, you brought this on yourselves, and now we all get to suffer the consequences fore better or worse.

I voted for Sanders in the primary and would have actually been excited about voting for him in the general election. He'd never have won here in the general election either, but I do think he would have won the Presidency. \n\nI voted for her, not because of any excitement or loyalty, but because I truly fear what the issues I consider important will look like after four years, at least, of a Republican administration controlling both the Executive and Judicial branches. Not to mention, the damage that could be done to these issues lasting a generation if two or three conservative judges are appointed to the Supreme Court, which is certainly possible, if not probable now. That could take a generation to undo and I'm extremely worried about it.",

Trump was campaigning for the hardworking American in those areas.He has promised bringing jobs back to them. He was in Michigan the night before the election campaigning after 1 AM. Clinton barely stepped foot in Wisconsin. This was a crucial mistake for the Clinton admin and props to the Trump campaign for targeting that part of the country.

If he accomplishes that it would give him a lot of bizarre credibility.\n\nWith republicans in control in congress we could see a lot of his zany ideas come to fruition.

You are forced to choose between the lesser of two evils and then are surprised when we end up with someone evil? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Let's be honest here: there were, without doubt, better candidates for both parties during the primaries, but we ended up with Trump and Clinton - why? Money and corruption - that's why. Everyone who is angry about this election should be directing that anger at the Electoral College, the CPD, the RNC and the DNC. I woke up this morning saddened by the news, but not so much because Trump won. I was sad because, even in arguably the most divisive presidential campaign in history, with arguably the two most disliked presidential candidates in history, the American people didn't even have the balls to give 5% of their vote to a third party so that they could secure federal funding and all the other perks of being recognized as minor party and maybe, *maybe* have a chance of effecting meaningful change in the future. I even witnessed some people lashing out in anger at those who voted third party, blaming them for their candidate's loss - literally supporting the system that gave them such terrible choices. That's not democracy, that's Stockholm syndrome.",

Trump, contrary to his opponents, directed his message to a part of the USA citizenry that felt that they couldn't/wouldn't be represented by the extant political elite. They voted for him, and they elected him. In effect, this is actual democracy in action.\n\nSpeaking with a friend, we realized this might be the best thing to happen to the USA, in the long term. It shows to the political cadre that they will need to direct their message to the people, and no longer to the medias/financial elites that were bankrolling them.\n\nI'm a little scared of what might come out of a Trump presidency. I believe the man is a ridiculous clown with retarded ideas, but I'm hoping that there will be a limiting factor in the weight of bureaucracy that applies to any government.\n\nAnd while I do not agree with the ideology of the Republican Party personally, I'm certain that amidst the vast number of Congressmen and Senators that were elected to both chambers, there are competent people that will do their best to protect their coutry from the potential excesses of a megalomaniacal man-child.\n\nEdit: Formatting",

But I'm sad and scared at this outcome.\n\nTrump's election has made me feel rejected and hated by this country and particularly by Trump voters. I feel right now maybe I'll never be a real American to you people and the American dream just isn't for people like me. And I'm honestly afraid...that people in my family and even myself will be targeted and not protected in a Trump government.\n\nSo no its not about being butthurt about Hillary. I feel scared and I feel hated.\n\nedit: Thanks to all the posters who have been kind, it really meant a lot. And  thanks even those who have not been so kind.\n\nI just want to make one thing clear...I'm not fear mongering. I'm afraid. I'm not bashing Trump or his fans...just telling you how I feel and why his win felt sad for me. I mean for a moment I thought about buying skin bleach after he won.",

It's no surprise that Trump won, nor would it have been a surprise if Hillary won, and there's be no surprise that Jill lost. Amidst DNC corruption, Email scandals, people treating others who vote for the other party as enemies, CTR and Trump propaganda and their absolute fuckery (no seriously, go fuck yourselves, you make me sick.) etc. this result was bound to happen. I don't fault these people for their personal and political views, but rather them and the rest of America who managed to leave the election up to 2 candidates who (lets be honest) no one actually wanted. You shot yourselves in the foot by letting this happen. You let yourselves become ignorant, you let yourselves be cut short to only 2 candidates, you let yourselves illogically reason to vote someone you dislike based on the fear that someone you completely resent may win. \n\nYou let yourselves regress and be lied to and accepting of so much bullshit and corruption, and then you wonder why a face of a reality tv show becomes president. (note: I hate both candidates equally.)\n\nMay there be interesting times ahead.",

Remind him of these words, and ask him to prove them. Ask him to promote equality for EVERYONE in this country, women, LGBTQ, people of other races and cultures? To promote not only the equality of these people, but to promote their safety and to work to heal their fear of discrimination and even of violence against them. Ask him to truly lead, and show those of us that didn't vote for him that he IS capable of doing a \"good job\"?  At this time, I think taking that kind of action would be far more effective than all the hate and sadness and disbelief we can throw around in social media. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Who among us would hold up to that same scrutiny?  \n\nThat being said... I truly hope that my opinion of him has been unfairly distorted by the media which I choose to consume.  If he truly is the monster that we fear, then our nation can withstand him.  Our political system is not a monarchy.  We will have another chance to speak our minds, with our votes, in 4 years.\n\nHowever, if he's not truly a monster.. if instead, he's just a flawed man, like any other, who truly believes that he can \"make America great again,\" then as an American I owe him the allegiance and respect that are due to the office.  \n\nCongratulations to President-Elect Donald Trump.

But bear with me.\n\nThis morning, after I put my kid on the bus for school, I put out the trash and recyclables. It's what happens every Wednesday. I got a glorious view of the sun rising in the east. You could hear the ducks calling off in the distance, and it's cool but comfortable. A perfect fall morning if you like to be outside. And that's when thing really started to hit home. The sun is still coming up. Life still goes on pretty much as normal. \n\nThings, in terms of the vote, didn't go the way many of us expected. A lot of us want to blame the other side. A lot of us want to focus only on the campaign run by the folks who won. Maybe, we need to take a minute and look at who we put up in this fight. For some of us who voted for Hillary (like me), it was a vote simply because it was the only other logical choice. This was by all accounts a lesser of two evils election. But both sides had the same issues. Both were divisive. Both had their skeletons in the closet. Both had their ideas that made you wonder what they had been smoking.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not happy with the outcome of this thing. Many expletive laden tirades were spoken last night as returns came in on my couch last night. I don't like Trump in the least, and I have less love for Pence. But instead of just grousing about the outcome and focusing on the GOP, it's time for the Democrats to look at themselves, and examine why we were so soundly rejected. In the end, I think if you really dig down, we offered more of the same. Trump was right that Hillary would just be Obama v.2. While from some people's view that would be a great thing, some people were tired of him.\n\nLook back to the previous elections. Bush the eldest lost because they thought it'd be more of the same. Gore lost because they thought he'd be Clinton all over again. Kerry lost because Obama offered the hope of change. And so it is again here. Some people were fed up with how things were going, and wanted a change. And the Democrats offered more of the same. They didn't loose to Trump. They lost because they offered up a candidate that was more of the same. And I say this as someone who voted for her.\n\nIn the end, the world is still spinning. The sun still rises. I'll go to work this afternoon. Nothing is going to majorly change right this second. And while I do not like the person elected, and I do not like his policies, it appears right now that he won fair and square. So while I do not stand for what he believes in, he's the president-elect. I do not wish him ill, and as odd as it sounds, I wish him well. It's the American thing to do: honor the transfer of power according to the will of the people. \n\nWhat we need to do on the left side of the aisle, over the next 4 years, is take a deep, long look at this election. It's apparent that we're out of touch with America, and you can see it in how soundly we were rejected. Time to retool, rearm, and be ready for 2020.",

Just do a little light digging and you'll run into the weirdness.\n\nTrump isn't stupid. Regardless of how Titian orange he looks every night and the fact his hair seems to be the equivalent of candy floss, he couldn't get to where he was if he was completely out of the loop. He knows exactly where the popular vote would go, and whom to exploit. I have a feeling that really, the only people who are going to suffer are the ones who assumed during this campaign that the Trump was their White Knight and that he's going to somehow change the system in their favor (a system which allows people like him to become billionaires). I'll be very interested to see how far he goes and if he even pushes the envelope at all. This presidency could be the most epic bore, or he might actually get people to do something.

I put the stability and prosperity of America above any candidate.\n\nNow is the time for Americans to come together and unite and heal wounds. Trump's speech was thankfully conciliatory and humble. I hope this trend continues. If Donald Trump proves me wrong, I am absolutely willing to admit it. We need a leader now. Trump needs to prove that.",

Here is the issue. Donald Trump on his own may not be dangerous, but the people who support him, who have been empowered by him going into office, are dangerous. Groups like the KKK and other white nationalist groups feel like they have a voice in this society again. As a person of colour, I'm scared, not because I think Trump is going to do anything to me, but because I think that I'm going to face discrimination from those people, and they won't be afraid to do something because they think that it's ok and it's acceptable. Mike Pence, Trump's VP, a homophobe who believes in conversion therapy, gives voice to the people who want to commit hateful acts towards and take away rights from the LGBT community. They just earned the right to be married, and we're still not a country where they're accepted fully, so you can understand why they would be afraid. Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric gives power to the bible thumpers, and to racists, who are going to commit acts of violence against Muslims, because just like the earlier example, they think that it is acceptable.\n\nIf you're a Trump supporter, I understand why you're happy. You did what you said you would do, you have toppled the system. No matter what, both the Republican and Democratic party has been changed, they can't stay the way they're. At the same time, show compassion to your countrymen and countrywomen who are afraid and angry. Earlier today, I unfairly grouped all Trump supporters as racists, sexists, etc. I was wrong. I understand that the majority of you're not like that. You're the same as me or any other person in this country. At the end of the day, we want what is best for ourselves and our country. No matter what, we have to live in this country. So, let's come together, let's try not to go backwards, but take a step forward. Let's make sure that NOBODY feels persecuted, nobody is discriminated against, and that nobody is excluded. United we stand, divided we fall is the biggest cliche there is, but it is applicable here. I don't like Trump, I don't agree with any of his views, but he won, and I have to accept that and we all have to work together to make sure that our country stays number one.  \n",

What are you going to do for a job? How long will it take you to find one? What do you even know about Canada? They don't want us.\n\n*Trump cannot declare war.
