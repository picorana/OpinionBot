I used to think they made really nice hardware (if I must be honest, I still think they do), but they've lost their largest selling point. Apple used to be all about integration- you buy a bunch of Apple products, they all work together, everything is good and simple.\n\nThey lost that touch this year. With the MacBook, they're trying to say USB type C is the future. The lack of any form of USB type A connector without a dongle is grating, but hey, they're trying to push an objectively better standard. Why the *fuck*, then, is the iPhone and iPad still Lightning, with a USB type A connector for the power brick? Why do we need an adapter to plug your own damn product into your own product?\n\nThe thing I can't really come up for a logical defense for at all is the iPhone 7's decision to remove the headphone jack. They're saying it's courageous to remove it and that it's a dead standard, yet the new MacBook (which is being pushed as a futuristic device) has one?\n\nThey're sending mixed messages now, and they've flat out lost their vision in my opinion. They don't have much ecosystem integration anymore, and that's honestly really sad- ignoring their bloated prices (not that some other vendors are any better), they really do have nice stuff. But they're not what they used to be anymore",

To have the game\u2019s most famous coach swear at him for not blocking on special teams in an exhibition game?\n\n>Oh, yes, he was mad \u2013 who did this guy think he was? Gonzalez played football the right way. He didn\u2019t deserve this. He stewed on the sideline, furious. And then it was time to go back on the field for another kickoff, another special teams moment, and the ball was kicked. Gonzalez locked in on a guy running down the field. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you (bleeping) block somebody?\u201d Sure, he heard it again. OK coach, fine, check out this block.\n\n>And Gonzalez absolutely mashed the defender, took him completely out of the play.\n\n>Then Gonzalez walked over to the sideline, and you better believe he walked right by Belichick, wanted to see the grimace wiped right off the man\u2019s face. But Belichick showed no signs of even noticing him. He was looking out on the field, seemingly oblivious to Gonzalez\u2019s presence. So Gonzalez kept walking. And as he was a few steps away, he heard Bill Belichick say this:\n\n>\u201cNice block, Gonzalez.\u201d\n\n>He looked back, and there was no hint of a smile on Belichick\u2019s face. Bill Belichick just kept looking at the field, and in that moment Tony Gonzalez understood. The man had coached him into blocking on special teams in the Pro Bowl.",

I think this is largely why I fucking love [Whiplash \\(2014\\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d_jQycdQGo) so much. It's a story of a teacher who knows his student can be the best, and he doesn't even for one second let him think that. He let's his student think that he thinks he's awful, and his student tries sooooo goddamn hard to prove him wrong. \n\nIt reminds me of that factoid about how it's easier to get a *right* answer on the internet by posting the *wrong* answer. You'll get more out of someone by telling them they aren't good enough than by telling someone they're great. \n\n\"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than 'good job'\"\n\n\nThanks for this story, dude! Definitely one of my new favorites!",

However, I think there's something to be said for the way he teaches. It's a fine line to walk, and he does it poorly, but I do think there are those who do it well, and my old coach was one of those people. He knew the difference between being a teacher and coach, and that's what sets him apart from JK Simmons' character. He would be hard on me on the field and give me shit all practice, but if we were in class and he saw something was up he'd ask me to stay after and talk things out with me. I discussed my sister being sent away to a reformation camp with him, I discussed my issues with faith, and I discussed my fear for the future and struggles with depression. He was a completely empathetic man, and that's exactly where Simmons' character failed. He always saw himself as the teacher, never as the friend, acquaintance, or equal. For example, where Simmons' found out about Neeman's past as a means to insult him, my coach would do it as a way to understand me better and grow closer. He left personal matters in the real world, but when we got to the field, play was all that mattered. And honestly, that may have been exactly what I needed at the time. To focus on something other than the struggles in my life. ",

He's not saying that if you say \"good job\" to someone one time it's going to ruin them. What he's saying is that if you just reward people for simply *doing* things you're never going to see their true potential. If you reward and commend people for trying their best and working their ass off, they will tend to do better. My coach (referenced in my other posts here) made me realize that my parents largely rewarded me for simply doing things. I had never been pressed or pushed hard in my entire life. When I finally was confronted with someone who wouldn't accept me simply finishing a task, but wanted the very best I could give, it threw me for a fucking loop. But, after a while, I started to get pushed by it. He kept saying I could try harder, and telling me I was \"wasting it\" by holding back. This is a man who never once swore the entire time I knew him. I heard him say \"hell\" one time quoting the Bible, that's it. So if he was being mean, he meant it. This is like Mr. Rogers telling you that you could be better. And he'd just say it over and over. \"do better.\" \"wasn't your best\" \"stop giving in at the end, it's not good.\" Just very straight-forward, but serious, criticisms that would drive you forward. \n\nI honestly think that's what a lot of people need.

They're going to be in the mobile/wearable space and a service provider (apps, movies, music).  Say this because it took almost 2.5 years to update the MacBook.

And after teammates congratulated you on finishing the sprint he would calmly come over and say something simple like, \"That wasn't your best.\" Or, if he noticed you not giving full effort, he would just say, \"That was awful. Work harder.\"\n\nMy teammates cheering me on never gave me motivation. It was my coach telling me I did worse than I could that pushed me further. That's what I think Jobs did. He knew what his employees could do, and he *demanded* that, and absolutely *nothing less*. \n\nI guess Cook is playing it safe. He's trying to maintain the Apple image, and that's something I don't think Jobs ever really did. I mean yeah, clean and crisp and easy to use was his thing, but he never once expected things to stay the same. He had no interest in maintaining anything.

Go back to the drawing board.\"\n\nThat was one of the big things he did at Apple.  He'd just be really picky about products, insist that things were perfect, and refuse to release products before they were.  A lot of his focus was to think about how normal people would actually use things, and trying to remove the confusion and frustration of using those products.\n\nIt's exactly the thing that Apple seems to be missing right now.",

That's how Jobs did it, but it's something that can be done management-wise through other styles.\n\nThe problem I see here (as someone who also worked for that company once) is that it really looks lately like the product teams have not really been talking much to each other.\n\nNow let's not pretend it was always the case at Apple. There had been infamous cases where some teams didn't work with each other well and it resulted in some major fuckups in the ecosystem.\n\nBut Apple should know better, because now it's all about the ecosystem. They're not making money off the iPhone. They're not making money off the AppleTV hardware, and they abandoned the router market and the Apple car project, just to name a few. It's all about the ecosystem.\n\nI've been a loyal Apple customer and user for well over a decade. I badly need a new MacBook Pro, but there's no way I'm shelling any money for the aluminum turds they just shat. What blows my fucking mind is how they have been on top of touch screen technology for a decade, yet cannot fucking crank out a notebook with a touchscreen to keep up with Windows machines. Don't those MacBook product designers have 5 year-olds at home? If they did, they'd instantly notice the first thing those tiny humans do is to touch your notebook screen to try to interact with it.\n\nAnd obviously, don't get me started on the cables.

After ditching Windows XP, I have spent 15 years developing a workflow on MacOS that just kicks ass. From soup to nuts. When I buy I new Mac I don't even have to set it up; I use a booatrap script and dot files and the entire setup process is scripted. Then of course there's my professional workflow.\n\nI can see myself using different hardware. I prefer Apple's aesthetic and design language, but I could get over it. What I could not get over is going back to Windows. It is fucking horrible.\n\nI have the most expensive, highest spec Surface Pro 4 made (from employer). It's a nice bit of kit, if quirky. But every time I open the damn thing to do work, there's something else I have to deal with. I closed the cover and plugged it in one evening and came back to it the next morning and it had decided on its own to update and reboot itself, closing down my entire workspace and killing (not stopping) Docker containers. His has even happened *as I've been working*, without warning.\n\nI could go on, but yeah. Just give me an option to buy MacOS at this point.",

They're just sticking to percentages as in; \"this product lasts percentage longer than our last product\" or \"this product is percentage thinner than our last product.\" They aren't adding anything new. Sure you get a new processor and maybe a slightly better camera but not enough to warrant the 600 or so price tag every year when a new product comes out. ",

If they added wireless charging as a secondary option, that shouldn't be an issue. But if wireless charging is the *only* option, then it makes sense to wait.\n\nIf you think about it, everything about Apples design decisions this year has had a feeling of awkwardness and bad timing. Why did they not switch over to USB-C on iPhone when MacBook launched a month later with *only* USB-C? \n\nThe answer is they need desperately to stimulate the wireless headphone market, so that the market is healthy and prolific by the time they remove the last physical port. That makes it a bit awkward for the iPhone 7, but it's pretty obvious that it's just a stopgap phone anyway. \n\niPhone 8 will coincide with Bluetooth 5 reaching the market (spec was finalized this month, prototype chips are shipping already) which will resolve a lot of the issues with Bluetooth, and massively improve range, bandwidth and power consumption. The timing would be excellent good for a shift to a pure-wireless product. But if you work your way backwards, it means they had to make some very awkward decisions for iPhone 7.\n\nThey will piss of a *lot* of people (especially those who were dumb enough to buy lightning headphones). Maybe they will ship with a case with a lightning or usb-c to bluetooth adapter built in to appease them. But it will pay off in the end, because they will be ahead of almost everyone else, just like when they shipped a smart phone without a physical keyboard at a time when Blueberry was the king of smart phones.

If Apple is very lucky they might get something like Solid Energy's battery improvements (2x capacity) in there, which could allow them to make the phone so thin that there's not even space for a USB-C connector. (I'm not gonna argue that making it thinner is better, but you'd be dumb not to think that Apple will continue to making them thinner, even if it makes sense or not)\n\nI just think that to explain removing the headphone jack, and the USB-C vs Lightning stupidity, you either have to think Apple is very dumb (possible, if Steve Jobs was the only intelligent person at Apple, as some people seem to think), or that they're planning for something. I think it's more fun to speculate about the second, rather than resort to the first explanation and circle-jerk about how awful Apple has become (as if none of their flaws were present during the Jobs era)\n\n",

Apple should have created a new global ecosystem for consuming and distributing tv shows and instead they blew it. They are on the right track with Apple TV - but it's just a half hearted try that falls way short. Go big or go home.  ",

TSMC won the contract to take apples chip designs and fab them. Apple could take their chip designs to any other fab and get nearly the same industry leading chips. They did this last year with Samsung. Don't try to assign this success to TSMC, it has little to do with them. \n\n",

My Psion Series 5 had an infrared port, and could interface with my laptop's infrared port using the [standards ratified by the IrDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_Data_Association). By the early 2000s the infrared port was dead in the water, with wifi and Bluetooth taking over.\n\nWhy do manufacturers not put an infrared receiver in phones and laptops today? I mean, it's literally just an LED and a photodiode, both of which are cheap as chips and insanely small?\n\nIt's because the added cost to manufacturing, added complexity (both in terms of software support and hardware points of failure), and mostly-dead standard all make it pointless, and even detrimental.\n\nSimilarly, adding an optical disk to a laptop just adds cost, moving parts that can fail, and limited value. And, as contentious as removing the headphone jack is, I haven't used the headphone jack on my phone in 2 years - and I'd hazard that I'm not alone. It's a standard that is going away, and fighting against that change won't make it any less likely to eventually disappear. Apple might be ahead of the curve on this, but they're definitely on the curve.",

From a DJ perspective the vinyl hype has died down from a few years ago in my opinion though. But that could also be me getting older and paying less attention. Also I can't help but feel part of the resurgence of vinyl is limited edition collectors items, rather than stuff people buy to play. But I still have a few crates in my room, most of which has been pressed and purchased within the last 5 years.\n\nI just meant that the fetishisation of old technology is amusing. When DJs started playing CDs, Vinyl DJs said they were cheating. When DJ's  started playing from USBs and laptops, CD DJs said they were cheating. I guess next when everything is just streamed as you need it USB DJs will consider that cheating. ",

That kind of thing has been tried before and it never seems to work out well; Sooner or later, often sooner, the rest of the world gets on board with a new standard that's better, or at least widely adopted and ubiquitous, and the proprietary solution just ends up looking like a childish cash grab.\n\nThe Android and PC world has done everything that the Lightning cable did with regular old USB/MicroUSB ports and cables, including audio and video out, etc. The only thing Lightning had going for it even when it was new was reversibility, which was quickly addressed with USB-C. Oh, and Apple's margin and sweet, sweet licensing costs. We can't forget those.\n\nIf they'd just stayed standard in the first place they largely could have avoided this headache, or at least rolled it in to the rest of the world's minor headache at the switch from USB A/B/Micro to C and not single themselves out like this. Devices or cables would still ultimately have to be replaced, depending on which ports they used where, but instead of condensing two or three standards into one it'd just be converting *one* into one.\n\nApple should know this. They unequivocally failed to set the world on fire with their Apple serial port (the old round one) and then FireWire. They quickly abandoned the thought that either would be the One True Solution to Everything. Turns out USB ate their lunch. (Twice.)",

Or they can drag it out as long and as painfully as possible and see how many people they can piss off in the meantime. It's their call. It's probably going to happen. And in retrospect, it's going to look like it happened 1-2 product generations too late when it finally does.\n\nEdit: One more thing.\n\n>Yeah that sweet sweet 0.4% of profit that they so deeply rely on. \n\nYou're gonna have to provide a source on that one, buddy. Also, don't forget the licensing involved for all the Lightning docks, Lightning adapters, Lightning car stereo ports, etc., etc. A large part of Apple's business model has always been accessory sales. The proprietary port was originally an attempt at vendor lock-in. (Notwithstanding that the 30 pin connector had extra features that at the time USB did not due to the lack of MHL. By the time Lightning came around, Apple could have gone USB then with no loss in functionality.)",

The problem is that we're now in 2016 and the 'Windows is shitty and broken' meme is no longer true given that the rolling release of Windows 10 is an operating system that is always improving meaning and for many Mac users the gap between Windows 10 and macOS has gotten to the point that the premium for a Mac just to get macOS cannot be justified in this day and age. It is really becoming more and more difficult to justify the premium as Windows has improved and as Microsoft ha entered into the hardware space which has forced OEM's to lift their game.",

They know their foreseeable product launches have very little to get excited about. Thinner, lighter, faster versions of the same products being announced don't have the same impact because we've heard it all before. With seemingly no new product categories to explore the company starts looking a little stale, despite still releasing high quality products. The fans have taken the quality for granted and stopped appreciating what made them fall for apple in the first place. True innovation of the same products year after year after year is impossible, but that's what the fans have come to expect. How does Apple combat this? There's an old saying \"You don't know what you've got until it's gone\". So guess what? Magsafe? Gone. Headphone jack? Gone. Replaceable internals? Gone. Dongles? Bend over and prepare to be plugged in. Suddenly, the fans realised how good they had it. Yet, while critical of the decisions to remove the features, they still purchase the products and Apples profits aren't affected. The only negative consequence for Apple is existing users perceptions of Apples latest products. This is part of the bigger plan though. Next Apple product launch? \"We listened. We heard what you had to say, and we've made some changes\" Magsafe? Back! Headphone jack? Back! Dongles? Thing of the past. The fans go wild and spend like never before, while spreading the word that Apple is BACK! And so, despite no real innovation occurring, in one product cycle Apple is perceived to be cool again.",

Instead they seem to be changing their strategy every couple of years depending on what the market is doing. That is not a company displaying vision. I think Tim Cook's problem is he isn't a technology visionary. That's not his skill, which I think he recognizes, so he relies on others in the company to assume that role - but my guess is there are competing visions. Jobs was the singular visionary and they miss that. ",

The lack of a ram heavy model, and they have officially killed their most loyal client base on the computer side. Apple died with Jobs. And, if the shareholders had any sense whatsoever, they'd fire Tim Cook with extreme prejudice. \n\nI agree. The iPhone and iPad should integrate with the MBP. But IMO, Apple was always more about innovation, which I haven't seen them do since Jobs died. Cook seems hell bent on squeezing every penny out of the consumers, and entirely uninterested in making innovative, convenient products, which genuinely benefit the consumer. \n\nI think Apple will likely be bankrupt within ten years if Cook remains in control. Which is sad, because I used to love Apple. They've even eliminated the groundbreaking magsafe port from their laptops, which has always been a big selling point! \n\nThe iPhone hasn't seen real upgrades for quite some time now (unless you count eliminating the UNIVERSAL 3.5mm jack, which nearly every audio device supports). The iPad and iPad pro are both worse than many windows counterparts. The software \nApple produces has been sub par at BEST over the past few years, with many apps being unusable (looking at you app store).  \n\nThe Apple watch is crap. Genuinely, the Apple watch, is crap. And the Apple watch is just as expensive (often more expensive) as feature rich smartwatches, which work a hell of a lot better, and don't look like a small child's toy. \n\nThere's been a lot of hype over the wireless earpods, which suck compared to most wireless headphones, and cost an arm and a leg. These could have been popular if 1, they sounded better than Apple's original earbuds. Or 2, weren't the price of higher end Bluetooth earbuds like jaybirds, while sounding like the ten dollar pair of skill can't earbuds on my desk.\n\nI was an Apple fanboy for years. I've owned most of their products. But, unless Apple starts focusing on the consumer, instead of shady tactics for profit, like dongles, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER APPLE PRODUCT. If anyone can give me a solid reason why I should buy anything new from Apple (other than old products being bricked by updates!) I'd very much appreciate it. \n\nIts funny, Windows and Android based products seem to be taking care for the consumer into account, PC and Android are the future. On the off chance that an Apple executive reads this, kindly tell Tim Cook to go fuck himself!\n\nThen, there's compatibility. I don't know anyone who would ever have said, \"god, I wish I had to buy some adapters to use all my current device with a new computer.\" Apple's clientele has been buying apple compatible products for years, and overnight, Apple made every one of those products worthless without extra components (dongles) overnight. This company is, once again, a sinking ship.\n\nTL;DR\nApple needs a new leader. Apple needs to care about its consumers. Apple needs to stop making dongles. Apple needs to invent new ways to use products an peripherals. And Apple needs to redesign everything from the ground up. Then, maybe they have a shot at surviving.\n\nOh, and why the FUCK is the iPhone still not fucking waterproof?!\nGo fuck yourself Apple!",

I don't want a phone targeting sixteen-year-old girls and middle-aged men with boring lives. It's the kind of tacky trash I thought we were over with iOS 7. From what I can tell, they're not entirely sure what they want to portray through their software now.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of the 6 design (everything before that, even up to the original iPhone, was a marvel of consumer product design unrivaled by the rest of the industry. I will give them that.), but I can't really complain about that here because, again, I'm getting a Pixel. And the Pixel is effectively visually identical (sans camera bump) to the iPhone 6/7 design. \n\nBut the golden age of smartphone design is long over, so I guess I'll deal. The Nextbit Robin's like the last harbinger, and it's far from great. ",

Being free to jump around has always kept interesting and novel products in my hands. It has made me constantly adaptable to new technologies, languages, methodologies, capabilities.\n\nThe single worst thing a user, consumer a person can do - is engage in brand loyalty.

My wife has a 6 and if she doesn't shut it off regularly, things will go screwy. Mind you she's not even at a year with it yet. Sometimes the screen doesn't register taps correctly, just recently I called and couldn't hear her. It wasn't me cause I had a few people call her to test it out. And the battery sucks. The thing dies so fast even when she's not using it. Maybe Apple used to be good, but holy balls of Christ do they suck now. The only good thing about Apple was that if you bought music from iTunes it would go to phone, tablet and computer. At the same time though, Amazon Prime does the same thing and isn't product picky.

I'm sure my 2012 one would still be running if it hadn't been stolen. I've had this rMBP for about 18 months now and can still get around 9 hours of battery life out of it for everyday tasks, which is great when you're a dickhead like me and forget your charger when you go work out of a cafe or bar or on the train or something. I guess that should be expected when you drop \u00a31k on a laptop, but Macbooks are the only laptops i've ever owned that still feel like they're out of the box a while down the line. All my other laptops have had a life of about 2 years. Maybe I was just unlucky.\n\nI will say that my iPhone 6 seems to have slowed a little since the new iOS updates, not to put on my tinfoil hat or anything about them purposely slowing it down wanting you to buy the 7. Always used to go for Android phones but my last Sony Xperia had overheating issues and nearly set fire to my jeans and I managed to blag a solid deal on the 6.",

I spoke with support and they said it was because synchrony ( the bank that does Google financing ) declined the transaction... Then spoke with synchrony and they said Google charged back the hold they placed, spoke with Google again and they told me \" oops yeah there's a problem with that, we will try and reinstate your order and you'll hear from us in 1-2 days\" waited 1.5 wks and then got a call saying to place another order, nothing they can do. I'd have to wait another month on preorder with no guarantee that it would go through that time... They said they may be able to bump it up and they'd get in touch with me by the end of the week. Waited two weeks and cancelled the order I placed again. Don't think I'll go with any Google phones since if that is the support they give when they haven't even got my money yet I bet a warranty issue would be a nightmare.  \nTL;dr Google cancelled my order after 1 month of waiting, told me to wait another month. Won't be getting any Google phones in the near future. ",

They gave me a free MacBook Pro 2012 (I had to trade in my old 2010) and numerous free iPhones. They've replaced numerous power bricks and even repaired a faulty WiFi card on a MacBook Air out of warranty. Just now they gave me a new iPhone 6 because my other one had a display problem caused by the frame being weak. This iPhone has been out of warranty since October.\n\nI like Apple customer service, it's why I have stuck with them for 6 years. I also love the luxuriant feel of their products, like the new MacBook Pro (I got the non-touchbar version), it's compact but heavy and is metal all around. The screen is amazing, I never knew such vivid reds and blues existed. It's like HDR but for everything.\n\n",

I find it frustrating that new versions of IOS make changes for change's sake, mostly making devices actually harder to use. \n\nI honestly believe that without Steve Jobs at the helm, or at least with Tim Cook in charge, Apple is in trouble.

Using the music app for example is harder because they've made the area you need to select to go back to the 'now playing' page so small. It's hard to read what you are currently listening to, or the text to choose new music. The text used to be much larger and easier to read. Seems to have to tap more items to get to the area you want as well. :)",

Long story short, I told them it was a battery issue, they told me it was likely a firmware issue. On third visit, they told me there was a battery recall that affected the phone.  I was pissed that they wasted my time when I told them the culprit on the first visit, and anyone that applied logic to the situation should be able to figure out. Oh, and since they didn't have any batteries available I had to call phone support 3 more times and escalate to customer relations due to each regular phone tech trying to charge me $200+ for the repair that was under a recall.

I don't care about power/price ratios when I have to deal with bad customer service with a PC company (I had an Asus at the time).\n\nThe Surface line is the only PC laptop that I considered a true competitor, but at that point you were paying around the same price than an MBP, so the argument you said became moot. Every other third party like Asus, Dell, and Lenovo failed me repeatedly, and no one took responsibility. I think that was one big reason why people began paying the premium for Apple products, because they were tired of the unreliable nature of Windows computers.\n\nThat said, the new MBP is so expensive for what it is, that it's very difficult not to recommend the Surface Book instead. Of course, that means that you're not \"paying half the price\", so I am still not convinced by the price/performance argument.\n\n ",

No way to charge it, phone is a brick once the batt dies. Did a little research, bought a replacement part online for the whole bottom piece, took it to the kickass 3rd party repair shop down the street. They said they no longer repair iPhones. Great. Took it to the Apple store... they told me I had to REPLACE THE WHOLE THING. For this little tiny speck of copper I broke off.\n\nSo anyway I said fuck it, and repaired it myself.

I think its a class/status thing in the guise of \"better experience.\" I have easy access to any choice, and it's just annoying. I do like its aesthetics and feel over windows 10 desktop... but portables? For the price? mac is shit. if you've got cash to blow, the pro ipad can be a laptop replacement.

Yo, so I pick one side, the other side becomes the other side. As soon as I pick one side, then I\u2019m defined as one side.\nSo, the one side, well, they\u2019re the other side, and therefore that side is not my side, so there is a difference-they must be destroyed. So, without further inclusion, I will develop my weapons systems, my defenses, my perimeter, telemetry devices. I will take laser-guided weapons and I will position them on the border, so that the other side knows that I mean business. Muahahaha.\nBut the other side, they\u2019re just like me in a way, they just don\u2019t want to be like me in a way, so I guess they\u2019re just like me in a way. So when you\u2019re throwing it all away and you\u2019re thinking about battling it up, just remember one thing,\u2026Who\u2019s being played? Who\u2019s being played, yo. Binary is the culprit, binary existence. It\u2019s your choice. You want to live in the middle? I\u2019d say that\u2019s a wiser choice.\n\u2026\nSo you get the picture man, Yo, you pick one side, you become the other. The other hates the other. They despise the other.

When I edited video for NBC we were using heavily customized windows based editing decks. As much as you could consider that \"windows\" somewhere at the core that's what was running.\n\nWhat are you using that prevents you from using Windows? I assure you it's just preference, unless you have an ultra customized bit of hardware you're using which can happen on either platform f that's the case: i mean the [raven z3](http://www.slatemt.com/products/raven-z3/) doesn't have full windows support for ALL software for audio post, but it's there for protools.\n\nI dunno, it's baffling to me how people are platform centric, picking the extravagant non-custom solution but then thinking there's some rigid requirement. Nope.\n",

I'm sure if you're a .net developer it's okay but for the vast majority of web development or systems development you really need that Unix environment. \n\nAnd yeah you can get that on Linux which is great, but Mac provides that plus the added cohesion and polish that makes you more productive. I personally don't use alt tab (cmd tab on Mac) anymore because of multiple desktops and gestures for example. Meanwhile on Windows, I'm happy if I can manage to point the mouse pointer on a track pad. It's night and day for me but many people here seem to disagree and I can totally respect that, they both have their merits. ",

If you want a laptop that offers a touchpad that nice, a display with resolution equally as high, all in a compact form factor with high build quality, you will pay similar prices.",

Xcode is also a great IDE. \nBefore I bought a Mac I wouldn't say this, but the whole computing experience was made more enjoyable with the Mac.  \n\nI am sure there are better deals, you could install Linux with a lot of packages so that it comes loaded with a lot of things and then you could configure the UI to be more appealing.\n\n\nAll in all, if I didn't need a Mac(Xcode) for school I would probably be on a Linux system.

It's a smooth user experience and the trackpad is 1000x easier to use than my expensive Dell I used for work (although it's a good laptop and I miss the touch screen). This means a lot easier to use lying in bed/couch, on a bus, etc. I find it annoying not having right click and I miss a lot of MS Office shortcuts but not a deal breaker. Also, most importantly, I've consistently had buggy issues and software crashes with PCs. This is across 3 different laptops (HP was awful, Dell still with issues) and so far nothing like that with the MBP. At least for personal use I'm not going back. Although I'm definitely not buying the BS they just released this year and will likely but the previous retina MBP used instead. ",

I'm heavy on Premiere Pro and After Effects for video.\n\nIf you go with Windows 10 Pro, there are a few ways to get Windows Update to not be annoying with only a few tweaks. \n\nAs far as bash, there is the new Win10 Bash, though I haven't personally dove in.\n\nOh well.

Well... Loll....\n\n\nGot a Dell laptop from the Microsoft store, and dual booted Ubuntu in it. I would MUCH rather learn a new OS than deal with Windows' annoying updates, lack of privacy and just overall bs. Plus I get really get to look into all parts of my OS if i wanted to learn how it worked AND customize the crap out of it to make it look just how I want it to.\n\nRight now, I seriously recommend anyone who is tired of both Windows and Apple to give a shot at Linux. It's really worth it, and it isn't as scary as it seems at first. I keep Windows in my laptop when I need to use design tools like Adobe CC, and for gaming. But other than that, it's all Ubuntu for me. ",

At least once a month I have an update forced on me that fucks something up. I have had my audio stop, antivirus stop, screen issues, and the worst internet stop all due to updates.\n\nI'm a simple user, I don't like having to hit up tech supports to figure stuff out. My brother has had a Mac for like 6 years and hasn't had to deal with anything like I have. His machine just works.\n\nThese may seem like small/petty/dumb reasons but like I said Windows just feels like to much work to me.",

With my desktop the main draw for me is the ability to upgrade my CPU, GPU, chipset, and powersupply as demands require. Right now I'm happily chugging along with my GTX 980 still, but I'll probably end up upgrading when the 11 series comes out to avoid having to dial back graphical settings in order to maintain framerate.",

If you stick around $800-1000 like you mentioned doing, you plan on using it for a long period of time, and you want it to be your only system, then like I said, you aren't going to find a better value than that.\n\nMost of my bias against them again comes from not being able to upgrade as system requirements increase. If I'm spending four or five grand on a gaming PC then it's a losing investment to put it into a laptop that I can only change the RAM and HDD/SSD of. If I spend say, $2500-3000 on a desktop build (portable ITX or a full ATX that isn't going anywhere), over the course of 4 years I'll probably spend another $600-700 on a GPU upgrade, and maybe replace a drive.\n\nSpeaking from experience if I buy a current gen high-end GPU, and skip the next generation of GPUs, I won't have to dial back graphics settings to maintain a good framerate in that four year timeline. By the time my CPU starts showing its age I'll be just passed that, spend another $600 on a full motherboard and CPU upgrade, upgrade my card again, and still be able to keep everything in the same case with the same PSU (even accounting for capacitor aging). Not to mention I can always resell old hardware to help recoup some of my upgrade costs. \n\nWith the laptop I'll probably start having to tone down the graphics settings about two years into owning it, and when I'm finally ready to upgrade to another system that can run everything at high/max settings I'd be looking at spending another four grand.\n\nThat's my logic on it at least.",

The only slight struggle I have had is finding settings that I knew the exact location of on windows, I've had it now for about a month and this is becoming less and less of an issue.\n  If you are still keen to rid yourself of windows I would 100% recommend the 2015 rMBP.",

Not worth it to me.\n\nRAM - If 32GB wasn't available then they shouldn't have shipped in my opinion.\n\nPorts - 6. They should have had 6 or at least add a USB A. Transitioning to USB C shouldn't be so abrupt. Do it over a span of two generations.\n\nKeyboard - It's loud as fuck.\n\nPrice - Right now the configuration I want is $3500 + tax CAD.

I can't speak for the performance of the 13\" but the 15\" one is great. Build quality is fantastic, performance is excellent (at least for what I need), I've had no battery issues and it's so thin! I was worried about the keyboard too, but I really like it. Every keypress feels sharp, I like it so much that my work laptop keyboard now feels 'mushy' in comparison. Im coming from a 2007 MacBook that was clinging on to life running Debian so maybe I'm more impressed than a previous MacBook Pro or recent windows / linux laptop user would be but I love this laptop.\n",

Google will surpass Apple and so will Samsung. The once mighty giant will become a slave to there innovation as they will be constantly driven by sales and not product innovation as it once was.",

I just can't fathom how they thought only having USB type C was a good idea. What a joke. If this new version had the same ports as the last model with one USB type C added people would love it. The decisions apple has made recently are really going to start taking a toll I think. In my opinion the iPad pro is a waste of time mainly because iOS isn't customizable enough to be a desktop replacement. I thought if they remove the headphone jack from the iPhone they would for sure add wireless charging. Nope. Oh, and I also think the Mac Pro is just silly. I'm not sure who buys that thing. \n\nI loved apple products in the past but they are making it really hard to like them right now. It also seems like every year they care less and less about actual computers which makes me sad. I think these senseless decisions should definitely cost Tim Cook his job. ",

And that's what the Air currently gives me.  \n  \nIf I could find a thin/light case with a ridgid keyboard/apple grade mouse, I could really get behind a surface.\n  \nMy 15 MBPr has turned into a glorified reddit machine 99% of it's life. The other 1% is a big setup/migration where it's nice to have a few laptops going on-site at once.  \n  \nI could take or leave OSx though. I LOVE the mouse gestures and window management, but that is all I will miss, most everything else is better on Windows. As a user of Mac os 5 all the way to now, and Windows 3.1 all the way to now, anyone that says Mac has the better interface is mistaken.

I charge my iPhone at night and it lasts throughout the day. Is it for transferring files? I've never felt slow on my Mac. I've been pushing multi-gig photoshop files around for years with SSD and 16GB of RAM and an  i7 processor. I have a 7 year old iMac with these specs, actually. Certainly never waited for much. I'm not saying there aren't users who require more power, but that market is shrinking. I'm certainly a \"Pro\".\n\nAt a time when the vast majority of pros in the world is satisfied with the speed and performance of machines (hence a very slow PC upgrade cycle... people just aren't feeling like their computers are slow or underpowered), I think Apple is right to index on thinness, design, the touch bar (or other gimmicks. And I'm happy to call them gimmicks.). When users are satisfied with performance, you need to wow them with something else. Not increase performance. People lust over sleekness, not ports.",

That's not a good enough upgrade in my eyes then. 16GB should be the base option now for a professional machine.\n* Compromised on battery life where they didn't need to. The previous generation of MacBook Pros was already thin enough!\n* Made the keyboard worse (IMO). Again, by making it thinner, there is less room for keys to go down. When I tried one out I could barely tell when I was actually pressing keys. As a web developer I don't want to be making tons of mistakes because the keyboard is bad.\n* Made it less usable. The touch bar could have been an addition to the keyboard F keys and it would've been fine, but no physical escape key is a huge blow to many professional users.\n* Made it less connectable. Only USB-C? How about some sort of transitioning period? Put just a single USB-A port on it, and that would make many people a lot happier.\n* Made it more easy to pull off of a table. Magsafe was brilliant, I love it on my MacBook.\n\nIn reality, the only things they needed to do, were provide some USB-C ports without sacrificing others, upgrade the performance, keep the same body, but maybe make the screen a higher resolution.

It was to be expected as Steve was an integral part of apple, and without him they were never very good.\n\nThe last two iphones have been very underwhelming. The antenna bands are just something that Steve would not have allowed through as they are not in keeping with apple's high standard of design. The iphone 7 was barely an upgrade over the 6 or 6s.\n\nAs for the macbook (their desktops are pretty much dead so I will ignore those), aesthetically it has improved, but it is such a confusing line-up of products. I am not sure that the new thin keys actually have much benefit over the previous type of keys. They moved to usb-c ports without anything supporting usb-c. I rarely use laptops without an external monitor, yet apple doesn't even have a monitor anymore. They still have the old non-retina monitor that is not really acceptable anymore.\n\nWhen Steve Jobs was around, apple was able to release innovative new products or upgrades all the time. Since he has died, there hasn't been a single innovative thing out of Apple. Sure, there is the new touchbar, but that is a very minor thing that will only benefit some people, and even then only slightly.\n\nI am not sure that android products are much better though. The OS still doesn't give me the same feeling as iOS. Samsung's latest phones explode. Windows is still Windows. As a programmer, it sucks that it doesn't have a unix underpinning as that is the type of operating system that all of our programs end up running on.",

I purchased the slightly fatter MacBook last year, and paid extra to have it beefed up a little, as I needed it to be more powerful than the base model for the audio splicing work I do, which tends to be bit performance draining. It's good for what I want it to do, but it is what it is - *a work laptop*. It's useless for anything else. It's a creative tool.\n\nWhat bugs me about Apples recent endeavours with their laptops is the greed for a larger audience. IMO, the Air is the laptop which used to appeal to kids and rich teenagers who just wanted to browse the web and FaceTime, and have it easier to transfer data from their iPhones etc. The MacBook Pro was a bulky piece of gear that didn't look pretty, but was designed for creative careers - it was ergonomically designed for those in creatively demanding careers.\n\nThe new MacBook Pro has been pandered down to appeal to all. The function keys have been removed, replaced with a touch bar which shows it being used with fucking emojis in the ads. The multiple ports and media inputs are replaced with a universal port, to be able to make the model thinner. The disk drive is also still absent.\n\nWhat's bizarre is that a lot of people I work with actually get the older models purely because they're what we *need*. All this simplification and minimalism needs to be reserved for the air laptops. It's losing them customers.",

That 2009 MBP is still going strong - build quality fantastic and rarely have had a problem with (apart from slowness before updating RAM and hardrive this year). I have used iPhones for the past 7 years and overall have been happy with them. Apple service on the phone and particularly in store has been great. I use windows at work and that's fine but have played around android phones but it didn't gel. I'm not a fan boy for apple but overall am happy with their products.  ",

Microsoft was entering that phase recently but are just about pulling themselves out of it, and that's almost unheard of. But kudos to them. \n\nThe best example is IBM. It remains a huge, huge company and while they innovate here and there, mostly they churn their old product lines. Apple could be like them. \n\nIn the new year a few things might happen (you might want to use the Remind Me bot here):\n\n- Jony Ive may well go off and form his own design agency, although still linked to Apple so that investors don't freak out\n\n- There will be some kind of management shake-up. I suspect Cook is too wily to be moved, and that may be Apple's biggest issue going forward, but some of the generals further down might get a bullet. Some of them might appreciate this \u2013 they've been at Apple a LONG time and people like Eddie Cue recently sold virtually all his vested stock. In fact, old Eddie might be the one for the chop.

To say you've never owned one, and then complain you can't understand why anyone would own one seems a bit hypocritical.  I used to always be a PC guy until I got to try a Mac for work. Never went back.  Do you pay a bit of a premium, yes. But their customer service and longevity of products more than make up for it. \n\nHere's a small example. Bought the wife a used MacBook in 2012.  It was a 2008 model. All she needed it for was surfing the web, so it was perfect for her.  About 12 months in, it started acting a bit wonky and the video card went out. I looked it up online, and that line of MacBooks had a problem with the logic board overheating. So what did Apple do? Even though the issue was traced back to bad Nvidia chips, they extended the warranty on those machines to FOUR years from date of purchase. I called Apple and even though my machine was FIVE years past original sale, and a year past the extended warranty, and we weren't even the original owners, they replaced the logic board free of charge. Now THAT is customer service. My wife still uses that machine to this day, and it still gets the latest OS updates for free (although that support just ended with Sierra). ",

Took it in and they said it was fixed, but it wasn't. Then it developed an appetite for batteries. It started to just outright kill them. We would get about 30 recharge cycles on a battery before it wouldn't charge anymore (the expected number of cycles is 300+). Took it in several times with the same complaint. They gave me free batteries and sent me on my way. \"Oh it's just s bad battery\". Eventually I had enough of that after 3 batteries in 6 months. I asked them no to politely to please fix the problem and not just give me batteries. The sent it to \"the depot\" and assured me they would find the problem and fix it. \"The depot\" kept it for three weeks and the final verdict was \"you need a new battery, that will be $300 please\". Told them where they can shove it. Eventually they quit making those batteries so the laptop is unusable if not plugged in. That's my apple experience.",

I hope you do know that if your product was under warranty during this time, you would be entitled to a full refund under the Magnuson - Moss Warranty Act, and is common practice for Apple to offer refunds or replacements for recurring problems. \n\nAnd whenever you have a recurring issue such as this always go to the higher level customer service rep. The low level guys are almost always going to look for the simplest fix (when you use different customer service reps each time, troubleshooting will generally start from the beginning again), which in your case would be to blame the battery.
