Tuning courses also cover repairs to the action and casework, along with regulation and some voicing towards the end. There are so many variations on the instrument that there's always more to learn. There is a one year fast track course using mostly software, but it's really just an introduction. Musicality has very little to do with tuning either, and perfect pitch is no help at all. It's purely down to time and practice :) ",

I am a Perfusionist and run the Cardiopulmonary bypass machine during heart surgeries. Get a Bachelor of Science degree, then go to a Perfusion School (1 or 2 year program). I am 4 years out of school and made six figures last year. I probably averaged 30 to 35 hours per week. It can be stressful because you can kill a patient very easily (won't happen unless you're careless) but it is very rewarding to know you are saving people's lives everyday. \n\nEdir: oh my God my inbox (More upvotes than Perfusionists in the US!)\nThis is from another perfusionist below! u/learned_idiot \nPerfusionist here tagging onto to the top comment. It's a great job but it's a good salary for a reason. You are responsible for someone's life in the most literal way for hours at a time. You can easily kill someone. You will work long hour by yourself. The call can be hard nights and weekends routinely and there is a cement ceiling for salaries. .\nThis is a great job but if you are someone who freezes up during emergencies I would recommend other fields. If the heart lung machine goes down during bypass its your job to fix it. Because you have stopped the heart so a surgeon can operate on a non beating heart. You have minutes to find the problem, Fix it and hopefully the pt is fine .",

I've been working in childcare the past few years, am in my early 30s (graduated college with a film degree and have worked at various entertainment companies in NYC before relocating). NYC life was not my style, nor was the idea of working in an office for years to come. Over the years, I have become, essentially, a \"career nanny,\" and have made more and more money with each family I work with. I now make almost $20k more than I was making at one of the top movie companies in NYC eight years ago (and I was an exec assistant), not to mention other perks, like going on vacations and one family who gave me enough money as a bonus to buy a car. Throughout this time, I've also been writing, and landed my first big writing job a while back for a feature film currently in pre-production. Yes, I have often felt like I'm not on the path of growing within a \"normal\" career, and it is ... weird sometimes for me when I'm with a family where the parents are around my age and super successful, and I'm just here playing with their kids all day. That does bother me at times. Social pressures, blah. However, I'm not an office person, never have been, never will be. Being a career nanny has given me the freedom to feel like my own boss, get outside a lot, and make good money. So........ Yeah, sorry that was long. But yes, childcare can most certainly be a career path if that's your thing and you're good at it. (And no, I do not live in or anywhere near LA/California.)",

I'm sure I've forgotten some.

Imaging in general has a pretty saturated market, so be aware of that. \n\nI just graduated from a medical laboratory technology (MLT) program and landed my first job starting at $15/hr ($19/hr on the weekends). I work 3 days a week, Friday-Sunday. As far as the laboratory goes, the job is interesting, widely varied, heavy on the sciences, and requires little to no patient contact. The majority of laboratory techs are reaching retirement age and the need for new techs is great. Every day has it's little puzzles, which keeps things interesting. Downside: a lot of burnout and negativity in the laboratory right now due to inadequate pay and lack of recognition. \n\nEdit: nothing quite like posting on Reddit to assure you that you have made garbage life choices. geeze y'all take it easy.",

The result is that understanding/researching the source data is pretty easy for them.

Turns out they just needed someone to edit a manual that was already written. It was a contract job so i was scheduled to be out the door in a few months. \nWhen that well was drying up, I looked up job postings in my area and found one I was super under-qualified for. I decided to apply anyway. I edited my resume to make myself seem a little better (no lying, just a bit of flourishing here and there) and shot it to the recruiter for the company. He worked with me the entire way, gave me interview tips, resume tips, talking points, etc. I was pretty blown away when they gave me the job but it turns out that the company was super niche, so likely any candidate would have been under-qualified for it.\ntldr; Build up a portfolio, doesnt matter what type of work and apply for jobs that are out of your league.",

That's tech writing done wrong.\n\nText hierarchy.  Can you navigate a document and understand where you are? That's tech writing done right.  Does the person just give up and not bother to read what you've written?  That's tech writing gone wrong.\n\nWe write for the audience.  We write for the client/boss.

You don't necessarily need to know the subject matter, as long as you're a fast learner. If you're a great writer but you struggle to understand technical concepts, you might still struggle as a technical writer.\n\nThe information comes from subject matter experts - I work for a software company, so for me, that's the developer. When the information comes in, it usually has two main issues. First, it's been written up by somebody who doesn't speak English as a first language. I spend a lot of time checking spelling, grammar, clarity, and changing passive to active voice. Secondly, it assumes that the reader already understands the subject matter (I spend half my life telling developers that the reason users are reading our documentation is because they don't know what to do next). So there's a lot of back-and-forth with the developer to ask questions like \"How does the user find this button?\" \"Where can the user learn how to do this?\"\n\nFinally, most technical documentation should be written with the knowledge that it might be read by non-native English speakers - so I remove idioms, metaphors, quirky phrases. I also replace things like \"may\" with \"might\", or \"as\" with \"because\", where relevant, becuase they're less ambiguous words.\n\nI love this job, it's like debugging but with words.",

If you approach university as an opportunity to understand the world, to network, to follow your curiosity and passion, then it is MUCH less stressful looking at your career options. \n\nI tried to follow a \"career\" path in college and I was miserable. It was stressful, my grades were poor, i became depressed, formed an eating disorder, dropped out of school. When I reoriented my perspective to follow what I was passionate about, it all came together. I have a degree in English and then I did a Master's in Children's literature. I worked for Penguin and Randomhouse for a short time (Horrid timing for me- the month they merged!), then I started working in a non-profit for children's literacy and theatre arts as a grant writer. Neither of those things seemed like great career options and my MA looks made up. \n\nI LOVED my college education because I was able to delve into a dozen different subjects- everything from islamic art history to organic chemistry- that help me understand the world and connect with people. That will serve me better through all facets of my life than just a professional education. \n\nIf your goals are to find a good steady career with a great wage, then I would rethink University as a whole. But I do think a lot of people suffer from not being exposed to more types of knowledge and I would love to see more people approaching higher education as an opportunity for humanity, not just as a way to make a living.

                            "body": "I have been involved in this line of work for about 15 years.  I began as an instructional designer, then a senior instructional designer, then an instructional technologist, and now am a manager supervising those roles.  I have hired approximately 2 dozen IDs over the past 5 years or so, all starting at 60K plus in the midwest.  There are those who will say that you need an advanced degree in Adult Learning or Instructional Technology, but in my experience I have not found individuals with those credentials to be a) more qualified or b) more productive.   Ideally yes, you will have both the educational background and the practical skills, but truthfully the growth opportunity (and job opportunities) is in online course development.  And (just my $.02), the people who drone on about Gagne, Ruth Clark, etc. are usually despised by their co-workers and don't get anything done.  Your job is not to pontificate about learning theories, it's to get content out the door in an LMS that keeps your company from getting sued.\n\nSo - if you are still interested and you are a graphic designer/web developer type - here's my cliff's notes version of what you really need to do to get started:\n\n* You need a portfolio.  Go create an account on elearning heroes, download a trial version of Storyline.  Inhale Tom Kuhlman's blog posts.  If you are even vaguely competent with Creative Cloud apps you will be producing passable assets in a few weeks.  \n* Rinse and repeat with Adobe Captivate.  Most enterprise / contract shops are going to want to see you can work in Storyline or Captivate.  Lectora is probably a respectable 3rd.  But again - you want to be able to apply and say - here's some online learning assets I built.  This stuff isn't rocket science.\n* Memorize Kirkpatrick's 4 levels of evaluation.  Not because it will actually help you in your day to day work, but because it is a bullshit interview question you'll be asked.\n* Become familiar with the basics of Learning Management Systems, and SCORM and TinCan packaging.  This is the delivery framework by which companies track who has taken online courses.  You can read up free stuff online, or there's a decent Lynda.com course too.\n* If you aren't having luck landing full time work after your portfolio is out there, there are dozens of contracting firms that hire people for staff augmentation roles to help large companies get projects done their full time people don't have time for.  Get a placement, kick ass and you'll be offered a job many times (i've hired several people this way).\n* Let your graphic design skills shine.  Build elegant, attractive, functional pieces.  There are countless corporate training types who try to make the switch to ID roles, but I have learned the hard way, I can't teach people graphic design, or how to write.  You just have to know what fonts work and why, and how certain layouts emphasize certain things, etc. And for the love of god, the difference between \"your\" and \"you're.\"\n\nI am probably a bit of a cynic, but I am dog tired of having to cover for stuffy adult learning professionals who can't actually USE the tools of the trade.  I'll take a graphic designer with technical chops and an eye for quality over a phd in Adult Education any day.  The former will actually accomplish things, the latter will talk endlessly about what we should do.\n",

I rarely leave my office except for when I work from home, but occasionally one of our trainers will be out sick and I'll get go out and teach classes at one of our offices. I wish I was allowed to do this more often because it really helps give me a sense of how our agents are using the software and how to teach it better, but I think my boss likes hiding me behind the scenes so I don't get the wanderlust.\n\nI taught myself how to code, specifically JavaScript, in a couple months after doing certain repetive tasks within our Google for Work infrastructure, and it really helps with my job. It's also a lot of fun!\n\nIt's a pretty relaxed atmosphere. I work with and for really cool people, but the downside is that this job can get very repetitive quickly.

Especially when there's such a liability involved. I think it's going to take longer than a lot of you expect no matter how good the tech' gets. Mostly because A) any agency just takes forever to change anything and B) it usually takes a lot longer than most people think for something like this to be tested rigorously enough for real world application. \n\nAs an example I ask; why hasn't speech to text replaced stenographers yet?

He is nearing retirement age and I don't have to worry about how he will take care of himself financially, which makes me feel so good. He is backed by a union that protects him, he has excellent health care, and he can frequently choose to do overtime which basically doubles his pay. Not only that, he's been to every single neighborhood in this city and has seen all there is to see. \n\nWhen my mom got sick with cancer last year, he had accrued enough time off to take the entire 4 months off, paid fully, and be with her every day until she passed away. No private sector job would have allowed that, and I will forever be grateful not only to NYC but also to unions for that.\n\nAlso, many jobs have ranks or grades, so if you stay long enough you are guaranteed seniority and pay raises.\n\nFinally, when you live in NYC and you are a municipal worker or are backed by a union, you are more likely to be chosen for affordable housing or union housing (there are certain housing developments dotted throughout the city with strong union ties). As a result, my family of four was able to live in NYC (and we still do) in a 2 bedroom apartment with all utilities included and a garage for $1000 a month. My brother's apartment is also a 2 bedroom with a parking spot and he pays under $1,000. I truly feel like my dad's job has allowed us to be a normal, middle class family and has shown me that sometimes college isn't the right path for everyone and that is okay.",

And they pay $92/hr, plus 17.5% contribution to your superfund, and a full-time teaching load is 4 hours of teaching a day (2x 2 hour lessons). That's $1,840 a week, or $95k p.a., plus super!\n\n\nAnd the lesson prep time is almost non-existent, as the universities have been running these courses for so many years that they've tailored all the material to be ready to serve.\n\n\nAnd the demand for English teaching from foreigners is increasing at a huge rate, and will continue to do so for many years.",

Most teachers I know spend at least an equal amount of time for prepping their course. That suggests that at least early on you might be working full time to get the course ready. Is that true for you?",

He came to career day a couple times.\n\nShe said their family liked it a lot better when he was month on/month off because it meant he could be there for a broader variety of things during the month off.  He would come on school field trips with us, come along when we went out of town for club events, got to go to all her little brothers' sports practices and games, etc.  He always got two off months during summer vacation from school so he spent tons of time with her and her brothers, their family went on trips, etc.   When he was working 9-5 he was always home for dinner but couldn't do all the fun stuff.\n\nI always found it interesting that while a lot of kids wouldn't like the idea of their parents chaperoning school trips and stuff like that, she liked it and always eagerly volunteered him when she knew he had an off month. I wondered if she was just naturally close to her parents or if having him gone every other month made her appreciate him more.\n\nI do know that he did month on/month off before she and her brothers were born and then worked a 9-5 position for almost a decade.  I think he started doing it when we were around 8th grade and her brothers were probably 5th/6th grade.   Probably too hard with young kids but more doable when they're old enough to feed themselves and bathe themselves and stuff.",

Usually there is a very long list of things to check or you come up with the things to check.  For instance, if you were QA'ing Microsoft Word, you may have a checklist like:\n\n* write a document\n* save a document\n* open a document and confirm that saved changes show up.\n* set font to size 12, write stuff\n* select text, change font, confirm font changes\n* select text, underline, confirm underline occurs\n* select text, change paragraph indentation\n\nFor a very large piece of software like Word, there are probably tens of thousands of test scenarios and most are probably tested via an automated QA system, and your job is more of a automated QA system maintainer.  Once you put something through its paces, you give it to seal of approval to go live.\n\nIngenuity comes into play where you may want to try to blow up software in ways that the programmer had not anticipated.  In our Word scenario. maybe you think of something like embed an excel document, then do a save-as non-word format.  Perhaps you intentionally corrupt a document and try to open it.\n\nWhen software is new, QA'ing the software is new, but eventually it becomes test the same things over and over and over again to make sure regressions in functionality didn't happen, etc.  Of course QA isn't completely sit in a cubicle and test stuff all day long. There are meetings and planning, etc that go into QA.",

With transportation, you can be in touch with multiple IATSE locals, working multiple calls and keep yourself busy/employed. Sometimes the paychecks take time to come in (i'm waiting on one from the PGA Tour that I did back in June), but they're worth it. There are often minimum hours on work calls, so you'll often get paid for at least 8 hours to load in a show, with usually a 4 hour minimum on the loadout. \n\nI started as an overhire worker;hauling gear off trucks and helping with bulk carpentry work. Once you've got knowledge and the IATSE crew knows you and your work ethic, you'll get set up on different tasks; lighting, sound, wardrobe, props, etc. Rigging is a more specialized subset of this, which pays GOBS of money in hazard pay, but if you're motivated and hardworking, you can get set up to learn from a rigger on a call, all while making $25 an hour at a minimum. \n\n",

Had a friend who had a botany degree from WVU who was one. He loved spending time alone in the woods inspecting the health of trees and looking for invasive species of plants.\n\nGood luck!",

He was required to attend but just goofed around and told jokes/stories. So cool. Haven't seen him in a while. I always wanted to ask him. ",

Sometimes the job title comes under 'Operations Technician' ,  'Desk Operator' or \"Panel Operator\". \n\nYou don't usually require any high level qualifications for the role, just be prepared to work 12 hour shift work, including nights and weekends.  Be willing to learn how to control the plant , remember that auto mode is your friend: the computer has your back and is designed to shut down the equipment safely even if you fuck up.\n\nAs you work longer hours, you work less days. I get paid \u00a338k a year to work 140 days of the year. \n\nThere are apprenticeships with every power company out there (in the UK). \n\nIf there's a nuclear power station being built near you GET ON THAT SHIT! Nukes are built to last many years and are a easy job for life , but opportunities are rare because nobody leaves because they have it so easy. \n\nEDIT:\n\nI've had a few people ask me for information regarding how to land yourself a job. Apprenticeships are advertised usually on the Generating Company website, in the UK we have RWE (Npower), EON, EDF, Centrica (British Gas) and Scottish Power. I've forgotten the other one lol. \n\nSo check their career sections and look for apprenticeships. Some do programmes for graduates, so if your looking at a more high level engineering role and you have a degree then they are worth a shot.  For a much better chance of getting a apprenticeship - ask for a week or two work experience at a power station near you , most should be willing to do this. This gets your face known and also shows you have interest in the industry. \n\nYou don't have to become an desk Operator you could instead work in Mechanical (working on pumps, pipe work, valves, boilers , clunky big heavy shit)  Electrical (generators, motors, transformers , circuit breakers , buzzy buzzy shit) or 'Control & Instrumentation' , the clever shit that automates the entire process, so when a monkey operator like me clicks a button it does what it should to the associated plant. \n\nI'd recommend going to C&I any day, as they're is such a shortage of people trained well in this field, especially when it comes to the programmable logic other computer related shit. \n\nIf anyone has questions or needs help PM me :) \n\nP.S You don't have to look for a Nuclear station , There are Gas, coal , biomass , waste burners, hydro , oil etc. I'd avoid the old skool fossil fuel sites as they are to be phased out in the UK in the not so distant future. There are so many \"Energy from Waste\" plants being built it would be an idea to join in on the revolution. Additionally, there is a massive boom in Wind Turbines , they would be a good option too. \n\nI've got so much I can tell you wonderful people please ask ! ",

You can find small gigs to add to your \"copywriting\" portfolio at freelancing places, but it's a very common method to just reach out (cold emailing for example) to small or mid-sized companies that have an okay site but definitely need some professional looking writing (native English-speakers are good for this) before their brand really takes off with their audience. \n\nThe biggest deterrent I've seen for upstart copywriters is the unexpected task of having to do thorough research to learn the vocabulary of the field and learning to properly convey the right voice for their client's target audience. You CAN be picky about the niche field you're writing for, but for the uninitiated it's almost a rite of passage to write across a wide spectrum of topics such as hardware, fashion, design, technical engineering, fitness, product descriptions, etc. \n\nCopywriters must also be willing and capable of breaking conventional rules of English to come off more casually or \"human\" for a company (which is another area native English speakers excel at). The nice thing about being a slutty English major is that you quickly learn to cherish nuggets of experience along the way, and will have many one-night stands to gain said experience before landing a major contract for a quickly-expanding company. \n\nGL if you decide to pursue this path, for awhile! The skills I gained still come in handy for me even after leaving the copywriting world, and it definitely was an adventure despite being a tough field to crack. ",

Usually the apprentices get stuck digging the ditches as a right of passage most of the time.

It really is a great option to consider. Just try and be smart with your body, you are trading your body for pay in a lot of ways. So don't be dumb, youth and bravado can make you do silly things. You work HARD so a lot of guys eat like crap and just want to veg out when not working. Its easy to fall into the same traps so just try and be smart and take care of yourself so down the road you can enjoy the fruits of your labor!",

We own thousands of dollars of tools/materials to cover any situation. \n\nPlumbing is tough work,  but it certainly challenges both mind and body. In new construction there is a ton of heavy lifting,  digging, carrying pipe/tools up flights of stairs,  fitting into tight spaces etc. You will be caked in dirt & concrete dust one day and soaked in water (hopefully just water) the next. \n\nBut you also need to know the plumbing & gas code books inside and out,  you need to be able to troubleshoot problems on the fly,  be able to read blueprints and challenge the engineer when the blueprints are wrong,  you know how to use every sort of hand tool,  know basic electrical,  welding, etc etc. A quality plumber definitely earns his paycheck.  \n\n*also the fail rate in trade school for plumbing is incredibly high!

He's got to meet a lot of like-minded people, and if he keeps his grades and attendance high enough, they'll actually place him in a part time job in the industry before he graduates so he can get real experience and gain credits for school at the same time.\n\nAt the end of it, they even help find him a job in the industry because they've got contacts everywhere and they put their name on the line as a reference (if he's a good student) if he chooses to search on his own.\n\nFinally, it's cheap and quick. 11 months of schooling, and $10k USD. Plus he gets to keep his tools (about $2k worth) and his uniforms (they're generic so he may be able to use them in a new job).",

Obviously your life story is a prime example of this.  But I also saw it every day with my Soldiers and currently with the PVTs going through BCT.  I will say that I don't believe the military is the best place to learn a specific trade (civilians are taking over more and more of the trade type MOSs), but it does provide you with stability and low cost education benefits. The caveat is YOU have to put in the extra time and effort to do the research, develop an education plan, and stick to it.  And IMO most importantly, not get pressured into staying in if it's not what you want to do.  The military does a pretty good job at keeping people past their initial contract, and that's when you see a lot of people in leadership positions who just aren't there 100% mentally anymore.   This has just been my experience so far, and I'm sure the other veterans in this particular thread have plenty more anecdotes and experience with this than I do.  Thanks for taking the time to write this up, I hope your post helps some people figure out if the military is right for them! ",

A lot of people here are talking about it being stressful, and it is - but it heavily depends on the facility (due to traffic volume, morale, and equipment reliability). My girlfriend and I both joined the Navy to be air traffic controllers, and worked at a shore facility for 5 years. I absolutely love ATC, but I decided to change careers after I got out because I wanted to do something creative. She is now a civilian working in a ridiculously hectic level 12 TRACON (level 12 is the highest complexity rating, ex. Atlanta tower), and it really does weigh on her. There are a lot of alcoholics in the industry because of the stress. Not to mention, there is a strong element of bullying trainees when they make mistakes, so training on a new position is one of the toughest things you'll ever do. Some of these positions take 1-1.5 years to get qualified. \n\nBut I also know a lot of air traffic controllers who work at level 5-6 facilities, and they're often bored with the slow traffic and want to move up (also you get paid more with more complexity). \n\nThe thing is, if you can't handle the traffic, you have to know that about yourself, and try to find a place that fits your skill level. It's an amazing job, with a lot of benefits that come with working for the government. You need the ability to learn a ton of info in a short period of time, while maintaining a high level of common sense, because no two situations are exactly alike. It's not for everyone, but if you can multitask while remaining calm under pressure, odds are you can do it, at least at a small facility. ",

Easier for workers to fix health and safety issues and get fair wage/treatment because they're paid membership to a union who can use that money to cover any legal fees or send in representatives. Also means striking is an option. Instead of you vs a bad boss, its a collective vs a bad boss. \n\nIn the UK Labour party was founded and is funded by the Unions. A number of politicians in Labour started off in factories and worked their way into union jobs and then politics. Think it's why we never had major call for socialist revolution like Russia and Germany as we already had unions and workers in parliament. ",

Radio remains among the most consumed forms of media, the infrastructure of radio in the United States is vast, with stations in every city, and even most towns. And most importantly \u2013 virtually every radio station is profitable, a claim that even the hi-tech world can't make. \n\nYet the pool of radio engineers is drying out. Put simply, the radio engineering talent of old is not being replenished, and this is leading to what many are calling an impending crisis in the world of radio as stations age and break down and nobody's left to fix them.\nhttps://radioinsight.com/blog/blogs/107223/the-looming-engineering-age-crisis/\n\nPeople graduating with expertise in radio engineering, FCC regulations, upgrading stations, mapping signals, etc, will find a dearth of competition, and high pay. The opportunities for entrepreneurship in radio are also remarkable. \n\nTo this day, I've yet seen someone recommend a college student to pursue radio engineering and it boggles my mind. \n\nSource: my father is one of the last veteran radio engineers in America.",

It can take a little digging but they should come up. Also, you can contact the professional association of the career you're looking at and ask-- in a general way, non-intrusive-- where positions in that field are usually posted.

There is huge demand out there right now too.\n\nAlso, while PM is certainly a way you can go, in my view it's not really the natural career progression for a BA.  Instead I'd recommend that a BA looking to move up in the world look at the role of Business Relationship Manager.  BRMs work with divisional presidents or C-level executives to understand overall IT needs, set budgets, and build multi-year IT strategy roadmaps.  This role is a little harder to find as it generally only exists in very large companies, but it's a lot of fun and very worthwhile.\n\nI know others BAs who went into user experience testing and usability design. It's another one of those \"hidden\" software development jobs that can be in very high demand if you're any good at it.",

After becoming as associate of an actuarial society, you earn close to 150-200k. I know of people doing that in 4 years after graduating. Plus the work life balance is excellent as well as job security. No need for an Ivy League education or to be at a Wall Street 'target school'. Also no need for graduate school. \n\nEdit: It's been brought to my attention my salary figures are off. This is my mistake since I live and work in Manhattan. My numbers are coming from my peers in my school's actuarial club of which I was a member. I am not an actuary, though I did intern as a summer actuarial analyst at a life insurance company and my degree was in actuarial science. The few associates I know in SOA are consulting actuaries, which might explain the high salary numbers. They all did it in 4-5 years I even know one guy who had passed 5 exams before graduating college. I now work at an investment bank. \n\nEdit 2: My benchmark for low stress is my current job at an investment bank, which is more hours even though I do love what I do now. I have a lot of respect for the actuary profession and know the exams are difficult. However, for the amount of money, I think the lifestyle is pretty good and certainly better than my friends doing M&A or equity/debt capital markets jobs. ",

One is when welding underwater you start creating hydrogen and oxygen which can build up(particularly dangerous if it builds up in the visor) and cause an explosion, so thats something you have to be mindful of. Then there is the general risk of drowning, or even hypothermia. \n\nI had instructor in a welding class who was an underwater welder for a few years. He talked about how welders can end up working in some  risky settings, for example he had to work really close to the drop off of Niagara Falls in an area that is typically off limits while doing repairs to some equipment. Another time he had to work along side this huge tube that was sucking up dirt and boulders around him to clear the area for him to work, in a near pitch black environment. But he also said most of the time he was getting paid lots of money to weld in knee deep water. ",

You can work at hospitals or schools but schools only want one if they even want one at all, and hospitals are the big bucks so those spots fill quick.\n\nMy school also told us that only the top 4 of us out of a couple hundred would be selected to go to grad school(which was a requirement at the time to be able to practice. I'm not sure if this is still the case but it's what I was told. There also may be more schools offering it. At the time there were only a few.)\n\nSo sure, it's unconventional and pays well, but gooood fucking luck!

Plus you get to do really cool science stuff!\n\nEDIT with more info:\nThe National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration does what their name suggests - research on the ocean and its contents, weather, climate, and a bit of space stuff. They employ specialists, who are generally experts in their fields, and officers, who manage things and skipper their vessels (and are the uniformed service people). Coming out of college, if you qualify for one of the specialist/scientist jobs, you probably already know all about NOAA and what you could do with them.\n\nOn the other hand, any natural science or engineering major probably meets the basic requirements for the officer corps, and may not be aware of jobs like this that require science but not specialization. Like most the armed forces, you actually spend most of your time on paperwork and meetings, but it generally deals with more interesting stuff and (no offense to veterans) your colleagues and subordinates are a lot smarter. You do get to hop out to sea periodically, usually just for a short period of time but potentially for 9 months at a stretch. Pay is decent at the entry level, depending on what your alternatives are, but after a couple of years it's not really competitive with private sector wages, even if it is a lot more fun.",

The gist of it is that the Product Manager is in charge of bringing together a lot of different people and sources of information (research reports, consumer surveys, engineering innovations, etc) and use good judgment and decision-making to decide **what should we build?** And to do that you have to answer the question of **why is it worth it to us and to our customers?** And then your job really begins, as (assuming you got the project funded) you then work with an engineering team to **design it**, and probably with manufacturing to **build it**, and some sort of sales and marketing team to **launch it**. At some companies (smaller ones) you might also keep it through its lifetime, doing **promotions** and whatever else is necessary until you **discontinue it**. In some companies, that latter sort of work might fall to someone like a **Brand Manager** or **Product Marketing Manager**.\n\nA Product Manager is the heart and soul of a product. Pretty much everything you use has someone doing this, who is responsible for deciding whether this phone needs to be waterproof, or have a 3.5mm jack, or whether this website needs to have a Customer Feedback link, or whether this line of designer jeans gets contrast stitching or not...\n\nIt's a tricky path because it's not really an entry-level job, so very few people find out about it as undergrads. You usually need to have a combined background of engineering, marketing, business, finance, or manufacturing (pick any 2 to hope to get in the door).\n\nBut it's very rewarding because you really feel like you made something happen. And you can keep making stuff, but it often has a very clear path to upper and executive management because you traffic far and wide in organizations and learn how things work.\n\nSource: Spent 6 years as a software engineer before I discovered I wanted to be a product manager. 9 years as product manager and I have a challenging, rewarding career that will take me all the way to the top if I want it, or let me stay right at the ground level making cool new things.",

            "body": "Medical and Scientific Illustration. \n\nIt's an awesome field that combines art and science for those interested in both fields. A medical illustrator's job is to create illustrations and animations of medical and scientific subjects for doctors, scientists, researchers, hospitals, medical malpractice/personal injury lawsuits, museums, veterinary hospitals, universities, medical device companies, and textbook publishers to name a few. \n\nThe main goal of medical illustration is to educate and explain medical and scientific information in a visual media clearly, accurately, and aesthetically to the intended audience. It is a field that requires an undergrad degree (most illustrators have a bachelors from either a medical, scientific, or fine arts background- a few even get undergrad degrees in [scientific illustration](https://gnsi.org/forum/science-illustration-education/schools-offer-scientific-illustration).) and a [Masters degree in Medical Illustration](http://ami.org/medical-illustration/enter-the-profession/education/graduate-programs). Most illustrations and animations are done primarily with digital 2D and 3D media programs like Adobe and Autodesk software, though traditional media like pen and ink, paint, and charcoal is sometimes used. \n\nThe job prospects are really good for a medical illustrator with opportunities at various companies, hospitals, universities, and freelancing. \n\nFor more information about the field, educational institutions and their requirements, and other jobs available to medical illustrators check out the [Association of Medical Illustrators](http://ami.org/) (North America) or [Association Europ\u00e9enne des Illustrateurs Medicaux et Scientifiques](http://www.aeims.eu/) (Europe) \n\nEDIT: For those interested in Scientific Illustration only the requirements are a bachelors degree or certificate in Scientific Illustration instead of the bachelors + masters degree for Medical Illustration. There are going to be a more limited availability of jobs than for those with an MS, but there are still plenty available in museums, biological researchers, publishing, and veterinary medicine.\n\nCheck out the [Guild of Natural Science Illustrators](https://gnsi.org/) for a list of schools that offer [bachelors degrees and certificates in scientific illustration](https://gnsi.org/forum/science-illustration-education/schools-offer-scientific-illustration).

Some examples of this are a certain few tech retailers, a certain few clothing retailers. Think of the brands you find in high end malls.\n\nKick ass. I mean just be a beast. You don't have to lead the team in sales. Show up on time, volunteer for additional shifts, and basically outwork everyone and be really friendly to everyone.\n\nMentor people. Help them be better employees, and better people. You need to have people go into interviews and coaching sessions with their managers and name drop you.\n\nGet promoted to something full time. Eventually get promoted to manager. This is really hard but as an idiot who almost failed senior year of high school and couldn't be bothered to wake up and go to community college, I did it so you can too. You're now making over 50k. You better have been doing 15% to 401k and 10% to the employee stock purchase plan while you've been living with your parents. \n\nWork overtime like crazy during one year. It doesn't matter how, justify it. Also by now you should have a LinkedIn and be making 72k as a manager (hourly). \n\nYour overtime pays off big! You made 97k this year! Congrats! And in retail no less!\n\nNow you have to get a new job, because if you stay at the same job you'll go right back to making 72k because the company cut overtime and your window to make the 97 your new base will close.\n\nHere comes the hard part.... now you get recruited by another company on LinkedIn. It just so happens they need you for a corporate project rollout and they'll offer you 95k plus bonus! You're now a senior project manager and you have your foot in the door in corporate America! Also, your college educated girlfriend now despises you, because this isn't fair at all.\n\nThat, plus the dividends from your espp, 401k and all the money you invested in dividend stocks over the years of living with your parents leads you to be making 120k per year with no college degree and no debt.\n\nThis will take exactly 10 years, from 20 to 30. You may be able to do it faster than I did.\n\n-sent from the 42nd floor of this company's headquarters.",

My current position started at $15.15/hour and I get a tiny raise every year, plus benefits. \n\nIt's easily the least stressful job I've ever had. I sit at a desk, occaisonally walk around to make sure nobody is dead, answer phones, and on the off chance something actually happens, my job is to contact the appropriate authorities and maybe point folks to the fastest way out of the building. Aim for office buildings. Colleges are a bit more stress(kids sure do love getting themselves hurt) but they usually offer gaurds a free course or two on top of their wages and benefits(if the guard is full-time).\n\nDon't work mall security unless they pay for your training though. The money isn't worth the bullshit and actual dangers they'll throw your way. They will hire literally anyone with a high school diploma though so if you're having trouble getting hired after your licensing is handled, go apply at a mall. After 3 months there(the usual turnover rate) you have enough experience to get your foot in the door with better paying companies. \n\nDownside: Half the guards you'll ever work with are incredibly impressively dumb. Borderline mentally handicapped dumb. It can be very frustrating at times.\n\nUpside: No stress and decent pay. It's also hard to get fired and security isn't a job to be replaced by robots anytime soon.",

Take the government administered test (multiple choice test with a 4-hour time limit) to become a Licensed Customs Broker. You can take the test as many times as needed (will cost money each time) and once you pass, you have it for life (as long as you pay your renewal fee on a triennial basis). Work for a Customs House Broker or a private company. As long as there is international trade, you'll have a job.\n\nI feel ass backwards into it during college, and I've worked for a couple footwear companies now... good pay, good perks, comfortable work schedule.",

I stumbled across the job while looking for a way to pay for school and have loved it ever since. The machines are large and most are older than I am, but due to being designed so long ago, they are surprisingly easy to work on. Once you've got the basics down its a lot of waiting for something to go wrong, and getting paid for every second of it. As far as I can tell there is no salary cap, (our head mechanic makes anywhere from $50-$120 per hour depending on what center he is working at.) There are schools/ courses you can go to and this will increase your starting salary but are Not necessary. Pay raises come frequently as you get better and faster at your job. Also it seems worth mentioning that there is a major shortage of pin spotter mechanics world wide. So work 5 years in the business and you can basically throw a dart at a map of the world and go successfully work and live there. (Of course there will be exceptions)",

Systems Integration is making the machines that make all of that stuff.\n\nI work for a company that designs, builds, and programs automation and robots for manufacturing. Lots of different companies cater to different markets. Some are in automotive, specific industries or more all around.\n\nThere's many different aspects to it as well. Mechanical designers design everything, tool makers and machinists build everything, and the programmers make it all work.\n\nI went to school for Mechanical Engineering Technology - Robotics and Automation and got a good paying job directly out of school. Around CAD 45k a year, but I know it can be a lot more than that depending on the company.\n\nPretty much the only downside is you have to travel to customer sites in order to install the machine (if you're part of that) but again, depending on the company it can be some insane amount of money when you do. A lot of people take on the large travelling jobs right out of school and then eventually change what they do in the industry in order to travel less.\n\n\n(edit: I should mention that starting at that wage right out of school was pretty damn good. Not only that, but it can increase fairly drastically)",

A lot of people I think go into comp Sci degrees because of how prevalent computers are in today's society, and want to further develop in that/see it as a stable future. I know I did. I just got the degree because it seemed like a safe option, but I didn't have a lot of understanding of where I would end up. I went to a job fair my graduating year and sent a resume to a place called acxiom at the time, now called ensono.\n\nRight out of college they gave me a good salary and corporate working hours etc. Really felt like they were doing right by me. I've been here for two years and now I'm a mainframe systems programmer, something I had no experience in coming out of college. I just attended my first IBM Edge conference a week ago and working with a coworker, we have a seminar on how to market the mainframe to college students with me as an example of the new face of millennial mainframes I guess. \n\nThe meat of it is that anyone who knows about mainframing has likely been doing it for the last 30 years and is looking to retire. This is going to leave a huge workforce bubble that will need to be filled. This is a great opprotunity for new hires to get that feeling of being hired right out of college, something that, from what I've seen, is increasingly rare.\n\nSorry if it seemed a little pitchy at the end but this is a real area that I feel gets overlooked because it isn't as glamorous as fb or Google",

I came to the school district and it is by far the best job I have ever had. Hours are mon-fri 6:30-3:00, tons of time off for holidays and one of the few places that has a pension. I dont get paid like some of the other commercial HVAC guys but I will always have a steady 40 hours and seniority is everything here so the chances of me getting let go are 0. I make 39.00 Per hr in California and have not maxed out my pay yet. Very relaxed job with 0 pressure. If you can get into a school district I say DO IT! Of course all school district pay differently but its worth a look!",

Now I'm interviewing at top tech companies offering stupid amounts of money.\n\nSo coding bootcamps in general teach you everything you need to know to work as a developer within a span of a few weeks. Most cost something like 15k up front. App Academy takes a percentage of your first year's salary but only after they have secured you a job. If you don't get a job you don't pay anything. It's as simple as that. \n\nIf you're lost in life and are trying to find a different path, I highly recommend it. My cohort had everything from actors to lawyers to accountants to waiters to bartenders to set designers to musicians to you name it! It's great for a career change or for starting a career. \n\nGoogle App Academy and read up on it and feel free to ask me any questions! I was in a shit place until I found App Academy so I know what it's like and don't want anyone to be stuck in that place like I was.",

            "body": "Within a school, there are tons of jobs that need to be done, but everyone focuses on 'teacher'. One of the big ones that needs more people in general is 'paraprofessional'. Basically, they're school support staff that can do a variety of things to help teachers, but will generally be assigned a specific task each year, and their task changes from year-to-year. Parapros are sometimes the 'second adult' in a classroom, if the class has one of several challenging aspects to it (chatty group of kids, kindergarten or first grade, the class happens to have several students with learning disabilities who need support, the class is over the district-mandated student limit, things like that). \n\nA parapro can also be assigned to work with one child in particular, if that one child needs an adult with him or her for whatever reason. Usually if a student needs a one-on-one, they fall into one of three groups: very young kids who haven't learned classroom behavior yet and need gentle reminders/someone to supervise them specifically, kids with physical disabilities (either temporary or permanent) that need help completing certain tasks, and kids with mental disabilities who need someone right there with them to provide the support they need to learn in a general ed classroom. Generally, I would say that about half of parapros at any given time work with groups of kids, and half work with one specific kid every day. Most parapros are also in elementary schools, but there are a few in middle and high school too. Having subbed for several years, filling both teaching and parapro positions regularly, I can say that having a parapro when you need one is a godsend. It's a decently-paying job that has you working with kids, but without the prep work that a teacher has. You also only need an associates to be a parapro.\n\nThen there's secretarial staff, administrative staff, janitorial staff, bus drivers, security guards (in some schools), IT, nurses, lunch staff, and several more positions I am not thinking of right now. It takes a lot of people to keep a school running, so if you like working with kids but don't feel like being a teacher, then you have options.",

Railroads hire a multitude of corporate positions that have nothing to do with working outside or driving trains (not that there's anything wrong with working outside or driving trains).  Accountants, mergers and acquisitions associates, software developers, engineers, salespeople, real estate managers, finance professionals, marketers, IT, etc. etc.  I stumbled into my first role with a railroad in a marketing dept. in 2009 while still in school getting a bachelor's in finance with zero experience in the field.  40-50k starting out, close to six figures 7 years later.  The railroad's have a very high rate of attrition and are going to have to continually hire and promote younger employees as the many baby boomers in the industry are retiring.  It's an amazing place to start and keep a career.  The benefits are spectacular and most railroad jobs are under the railroad retirement umbrella, keeping you away from a depleting social security account.  One railroad I worked for literally had three retirements... 401k (with matching), an internal pension plan, and railroad retirement.  Healthcare is incredibly cheap working for the railroad.  I pay under $200 per month for a \"Cadillac plan\" that includes my wife and kids.  I could go on and on... My career went so well that my wife switched careers and went to railroading.  Best decision she's ever made with her work.\n\nEdit:  Forgot to explain that both I and my wife are railroaders.",

I graduated highschool with only a term needed for an associates degree but took half a term of credits and realized I just didn't know exactly what I wanted to do so I got a crap job making pizzas. \n\nFood, not glamorous by any means. I hate the public but I still faked he hell out of it just because it's what I do. I did what was asked of me and asked for help when I needed it and followed directions given. Now I oversee 5 store fronts and am in charge of about 150-200 people at any time. I don't deal with the public anymore and I make closer to 100k a year than anyone I know that attended the university I lived near. My jobs not going anywhere since everyone needs to eat and that's not changing any time soon. \n\nAnother option for the college age people that gets more and more overlooked is trade schools. My backup plan has always been to become an electrician. Most schools will give you a job where you earn a wage and go to school 1 night a week with all the training you need to become an electrician journeyman. Average starting wage is $23/hr!\n\nComputers are also something that everyone thinks they need to go to school for years to become certified for a good career in. In reality, most people I've met who are software engineers got their start by dropping $50 on an A+ certification book, studying that in their spare time and then getting a certification in it. Once they get that they can pretty much get most any certification thereafter and land a decent tech job without the looming student loan debt.\n\nFar too much importance is placed on going to college for younger generations and its doing nothing but feeding the debt machine. My best advice is not to go to college straight from highschool and find what you actually want to do before stacking up loans. Chances are you'll earn more than any of your friends who went for a degree that they don't realize isn't worth much due to the fact there aren't unlimited jobs in every career field out there. ",

The gist of it is that we are the bridge between engineers and the field. We have a multitude of capabilities ranging from working on massive construction projects, to housing, to even establishing property lines for existing lots and structures. As for what we do when we are out there; we take measurements. If you drive by construction sites and see wood sticking out of the ground with colored ribbon, that is from a surveyor. We measure distances and elevations and provide said measurements to the other trades and inspectors along with directions for how to build said item. Everyone seems to think plumbers, electricians, and every other trade just goes out and puts their stuff in easy like. In reality surveyors examine the plans the engineers provide and will instruct the trades how to accomplish what the engineers have planned. Got a storm drain that needs to go in? Surveyors come out measure the ground, tell how far a hole needs to go down, and how low the pipe will sit in said hole. There is a lot of math involved  (mostly trig) and a lot of physical work but as a starting apprentice you can make 18.50/hrs with no college experience. The best way to get in is through a union. The union will give you benefits, pay for your school, and even help you find employment. All you need to get in is to take a entrance exam (the exact study guide for which they will provide you with). There are a lot of big projects brewing in the U.S. so it is definitely going to be in high demand in the coming decade.",

I ensure that residents get great care, that their rights are respected, that our building makes a profit, and that I'm generating a positive culture for our staff. My average day is a few meetings and a look at financials, then off to the floors to check on the resident and employee life. Who is in a down mood today? What employee needs a little attention? When is the next wii bowling tournament? (I love dominating the competition in this regard). \n\n\n\nHow do you get a job like mine? For requirements you'll need a bachelor's degree. Although mine is the only position in a local facility that requires that degree. You'll also need a 6 month to 9 month internship depending on your degree level. This is called an administrator in training program (AIT). Sometimes these are paid internships and sometimes they are not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes you stick out from the pack? You need to be good at financials and good with people. For an administrator, I'm not necessarily looking for someone that knows tons about long term care. I just need you to know enough to keep departments in check. Really, I need someone that can hire smart people and keep them sane. Someone that can be firm, but fair. And someone that realizes that good management is way more than letting people know how much they suck at something, but rather it's taking the employees you have and finding a way to make them better so you can give excellent customer service while providing clinical excellence. I can teach people financials, but I can't teach them how to not be a dick.\n\n\nThat's all. If you are interested in learning more about long-term care, feel free to ask me!",

            "body": "I wouldn't say that kids are not aware it exists, but jobs in construction/trades are highly underrated. Everyone's always told you have to go to university.... why? I somewhat suspect it's a product of the system. We're told by teachers, parents and other authority figures that we need to have an education, and many of those people discount the trades right off the bat, when they say education, they mean college or uni, which is sad, a journeymen certificate definitely qualifies.\n\nThe trades are a good path to several things:\n\n1) useful life skills - knowing how to use basic tools comes in handy for home repair or renovations, not to mention if you're an electrician or a plumber or something more specialized than simply working as a carpenter, you'll gain a skill that often costs hundreds of dollars to have a service call performed which you can now do for free (and possibly even make some additional cash doing side jobs, if that's your thing).\n\n2) 5 years for most journeymen certifications, which is a relatively short span of time to reach the higher end of the pay scale in a career (and this is before you consider specialized certifications beyond journeyman, or the possibilities of owning a business for yourself). Most journeymen where I'm living are in between 35-40 per hour, which while you won't get filthy rich, would afford you a pretty decent lifestyle, roughly 80K/year, and possible to get 100K a year easily when you consider opportunities to work overtime or weekends or whatever.\n\n3) unlikely that your job will be replaced by a robot in the near future - there will always be jobs for skilled tradesmen, in our lifetimes anyway, even if it is simply servicing or repairing the billions (probably trillions) of previously constructed buildings. New construction might be impacted, but as every building is different and has unique challenges, it will be a long time yet before a robot can effectively diagnose and perform repair work/renovations without a person present.\n\n4) as alluded to above, the trades are just a beginning - positions in estimating, project managing, site superintendent, ownership are all possible through the trades, or more specialized programs such as elevator tech, wind turbine repair, that sort of high-paying but somewhat dangerous profession. You could also branch off into the supplier side of the construction industry and go into sales or whatever - a degree isn't really necessary for this if you already have the knowledge gained from working on the construction side of your industry.\n\n5) having a trade doesn't mean you can't go to university later, it will always be there - sometimes I would suggest the best thing one can do, especially if you don't know what you want to go to college or university for, is pick up a trade. Instead of spending 10's of 1000's of dollars on a degree you may not even use or like, why not start earning money right away, learn some useful skills, and in the meantime give yourself a chance to grow, develop, and determine what path you may want to walk in life. Might surprise yourself and realize you're very happy working with your hands, getting to see something you helped build come up out of the ground and become an occupied business or house or whatever you happen to be working on. It's neat driving around your city after you've spent many years in the trade thinking \"i helped build that!\".\n\nI may be biased, I've been fortunate to have been raised in a trade from an early age, 13, and never really looked back other than trying university for a year when I was 18 (and despising it), but I still believe what I've written here is true. Construction can be a great career, and that is a very generic term, construction, that encompasses a whole lot of different jobs, from engineering to the guy who actually digs the hole in the ground for the building foundation.",

I work as a system operator for the electric utility industry in the western US and I make about $70 an hour to work shift work.  If you're willing to start at a local utility making between $30 - $50 an hour you can eventually get your NERC certification and move into a control room.  From there you can become management or decide to continue doing rotating shift work in front of computers all day.  As someone mentioned before, with rotating shift work you do get quite a bit of time off to recover from the rotating shifts and there are plenty of opportunities for overtime.  Last year I opted to take 500 hrs of overtime but I could have opted out.  If anyone wants to know more just let me know.\n\nEDIT:  The job basically entails making sure electricity gets from the generators to homes and businesses reliably and safely.  You make sure not to overload transmission / distribution lines.  No one thinks about how their electricity gets to their home besides the line out to the road so kids often don't think about that line of work.",

Most people are only looking at pure salary, which of course is fantastic but my job is absolutely incredible for a number of reasons.  I am a Sales Engineer at a software company that specializes in data security.  Basically, I'm the technical expert in the software, and I work with a Sales Rep to sell our software.  While my title has \"Sales\" in it, there is very little selling involved as the Engineer, all I am really expected to do is be a technical expert and know every little thing about our software.  I make 100k BASE, with up to 20k commission bonus based on quota.  **So if we were to sell ZERO all year, I would still make 100k**.  I've made about 12k so far in commission, and the best part is that it's monthly so you're not waiting all year for that Christmas Bonus.\n\nBy far the best part of my job is the hours.  I work from home FULL TIME, and I am not exaggerating when I say this, but I work on average between 6-12 hours a week.  On the busiest weeks (end of quarter, end of year) I may work up to 18-20 hours a week.  I have never worked more than 30 hours a week.  Basically, if I'm not on a call with a customer or onsite, I'm not working.  This allows me to do pretty much whatever I want, as long as I schedule things around my calls.  I go to the gym every day between 9-11am.  I don't have to take PTO for doctors/dentists/random errands.  I can go to the pool at noon if my day isn't busy, I can play Rocket League in between calls.  It literally sounds like a made up job but I swear it's the most incredible thing I could have possibly found.  I have friends making 250k+ in i-banking and they're miserable, quality of life is way more important than pure salary.\n\nIf anyone is interested in any of this, I'd be happy to answer more questions.",

The real money starts if you have the experience to go contracting. I know guys in Saudi Arabia making about \u20ac2000 a week tax-free with 737 type-ratings. \nBusiest times of year are winter months, so lots of overtime to be had here... Summers are dead because all the planes are flying, making money. This means the hangars don't want loads of guys hanging around doing nothing. This is where the overtime comes in... Say you accumulate 2 months of overtime during the year, on top of your mandatory 2 or 3 weeks holidays, you can decide to take nearly 3 months holidays, or you can take the money instead, or a mix in between like 50% holidays, 50% cash, 25/75, whatever.. So you can have 2 months holidays, and a nice cash bonus to go spend. Lots of guys go contracting around the world (Saudi, Malaysia, Australia, etc.) during the summer months.\nAnd if you can get type-rated on the new Boeing 787 (costs about \u20ac25,000) you'll be paid about \u20ac100 per hour!

Also, if you\u2019re full-stack, you can work on personal projects and possibly work for yourself one day. That\u2019s what I\u2019m currently trying to do.\n\n**DOWNSIDES**: Interviews at top-tier places can be challenging. if you don\u2019t have a backbone people will take advantage of you and you can end up working 60-80 hours a week at some tech sweatshop. You need to remember that you have an in-demand skill. Leave after your work day is done, and if they are taking you for granted, forcing you to work late, and not paying you what you\u2019re worth, go somewhere else. You will get like one recruiter a week messaging you on LinkedIn with an opportunity, and you are responsible for ensuring your work-life balance.",

The days are long, I won't lie and you're home relatively little. But if you're 18 or 20-something it's a great way to see the 48, maybe the continent depending which company you get on with. If you're young and/or have no strings holding you down you can just live out of the truck and bank up money. Should be making at least 40-50k/year. The industry is hemorrhaging drivers, the older ones are retiring and few young drivers filling the ranks. Always a job to fall back on as you should be able to get on just about anywhere as long as you don't fail a drug test or be at fault for any major accident. Put in a few years and you could easily transition to operations in the office, or get your own truck if you like it well enough, or specialize into flatbed/hazmat which usually pays much better. \n\nI hesitate to recommend it to anyone because if you have loved ones or any sort of real commitment that keeps you tied to a general area it's not gonna be a good time. Even without that it can get super lonely and dispatchers can be a pain (source: I'm a dispatcher). But if you don't have that and don't mind living a more nomadic lifestyle for a handful of years I've been hard pressed to find a better way the build up some financial reserves to get you set up proper for your mid/late 20's wherever you decide to plant roots. And just moving into dispatch/operations when you're done you ought to be able to maintain a fairly comfortable middle class lifestyle.\n\nEDIT: I worry a bit about self driving vehicles on the horizon. But I don't, realistically, see it catching on in any really big way for the next 10-15 years at least.",

I work in construction, specifically the mechanical (plumbing/pipefitting) side of things, and I see our guys get older every year while the incoming apprentices get fewer and fewer. So far this year we've accepted less than a dozen into the apprenticeship program because there aren't enough applicants. A lot of young people tend to overlook the blue-collar trades because they aren't glamorous and because they've always been pushed towards college. Our apprentices start out at about $17/hour plus benefits, working during the summers and getting their education in the winters. By the time they turn out (about 5 or 6 years later) they have the potential to take home $50+/hour plus benefits. I should note specifically that there is a shortage of plumbers in my area. Sometimes we struggle to get enough pipefitters, but if you send out to the hall for a plumber you could be waiting months. \n\nSo yeah, if you're looking to get paid to learn and get guaranteed health benefits, the trades might be right for you.

If you are planning on getting a degree in Anthropology (no matter what your focus is, I know Culturals and Bios who work as techs for some extra scratch during the summer) then I would reccomend joining your state archaeology society, and perhaps going to your local archaeology conference.

Governments desperately need GIS techs because a lot of the planners or drafters who learned GIS on-the-job are aging out or have no idea how to work with the newer web-mapping technologies. The federal government and defense contractors desperately need more GIS people, especially with security clearances.

There are a lot of science-relevant jobs out there that don't require advanced degrees. I myself have received a masters in immunology while working as a researcher for a biotech. The goal was to have a high enough clout to rise through the ranks. But there's a significant glass ceiling for anyone who doesn't have a doctorate. This is the same in pharma and in most research based science jobs. \n\nAs a fairly outgoing and creative person, I was also unhappy with the critical nature and rigid life of being in research science. THEN CAME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELL DRUGS!! To turn my expertise in science and apply it to making the science behind therapies sing both creatively and accurately to physicians. This involves creating concepts/images/headlines that take the way a drug works biological and clinically and making it in to something that awesomely represents more, that represent human truths.\n\nNow, yes, pharma isn't all good. It's a business with money in mind. There's lobbying. All of that. But my experience has been that the more life saving and positively game-changing that a therapy is, the more complex it is and the more it requires scientific expertise to understand and then communicate to others. This is to say, I have not had to sell skin creams. I work on therapies that are genuinely needed and that genuinely help those with life threatening conditions. \n\nI know for a fact that I'm rare in my profession. Someone that is creative, outgoing, and scientifically smart/savvy. It's a real leg up for me, and while I would rather not have competition, I think any science kid who feels a little out of place in that world but doesn't want to give up the science should look in to this path. \n\n\nEdit: I work in a Pharma Advertising and Communications Agency. Not on the \"client side\" as we say (at a Pharma company). We get to be more crazy, goofy, fun because we're not a giant corporation. Think MadMen with smarts.",

Anything from patient lift equipment up through MRI, CT, X-ray, basically anything that comes in contact with a patient.

But it's not as hard as most conventional IT positions.  I work at a medium sized library and my position basically consists of helpdesk stuff for users and patrons most of which is really rudimentary \"is the monitor turned on?\" level problems and coordinating with vendors when something rarely goes wrong with our system.

The base salaries typically start in the 60k-ish range but on top of that you'll typically get per diem (I get paid $450/wk untaxed just to be here) and an uplift (a percentage of your salary for working a non-standard schedule (I.E., 6x10s, night shift, etc.). \n\nIf you don't want to go the college route, learn how to weld or be an electrician. Especially in the union areas, those guys make killer money. I just had a union pipe welder drag up from my job to go make $72/hr + $130/day per diem. ",

I've done work for the Gap Store and their sister stores, Dominos, AllState, the Kroger line of stores and many many others. I've done everything from ran cable to installed and updated pin pads and self-checkout machines in-stores. I started with a company for $11/hr that advertised as pc repair but ended up using cheap tech labor for field jobs and after three months when I had my own tools and learned they were basically sending me blind to jobs I left and started working by myself. I learned the platforms they used and took advantage of them because they were meant for independent technicians not companies. (Side note I actually got the interview from the company on reddit, they were posting in my local city jobs reddit) Usually make anywhere from $30-$60/hr for the work above. I knew a lot about computers and networking and started picking up Cisco and other server/networking jobs for $60+/hr, sometimes as easy as a server ram upgrade, some other times install updates and wait there for a while or swap the server and transfer the data. Data center tickets are also common but they are a bit more involved and I tend to pass on them until I get certified and feel more comfortable with the systems. Voip systems such as Mitel, Nortel or Avaya also pay very well and sometimes you can remote in and fix the issue but they require I bit more specialized knowledge, these were the service calls I dreaded working for my first company but now at $60/hr vs $11/hr it's a little easier to swallow, but unlike most things you can't just google these solutions and systems so it'll take a while to learn unless you're lucky enough to be sponsored and sent to be trained at their facilities. Keep in mind this is all pre-tax and 1099 so you'll have to pay taxes unless you have a good accountant. Haven't bothered getting my A+ because it cost money and it's kind of outdated so I'm focusing on something like Network, Security, or CCNA. I am 22 years old, university drop out because Computer Systems Engineer didn't mean what I thought it did and also work for Domino's as a delivery driver. I basically have the ultimate flexibility because I choose what jobs I apply for and accept and domino's basically lets me choose my schedule. Sometimes I don't work for weeks :| I'm working on that.\n\nJust to clarify this is not a 40 hour/week job, I basically do this part-time with my dominos job, it takes time to build a reputation on the freelance sites but also I don't want to get burnt out. I've received offers from Toshiba and Fujitsu to become a technician but I'm still trying to figure out my life so I don't want to be locked down. My fellow technicians who are older and began around when I did are now doing this full-time and are happy where they are. ",

All of a sudden your zero job experience turns into a 4 year management position where you were in charge of 25 people, over saw a budget of x million dollars, and have 4 years experience now. Not to mention O-1 makes about $2,972.40 base pay plus housing (San Diego is about  $2,100 a month) and other allowances. So starting you make about $6k a month. Plus VA home loan benefits. Just keep in mind if you're using the system to get a leg up focus on the goal. Get ahead and get out. I got caught up and did 7 years, and now I'm realizing I should've stuck to my 4 year plan. ",

I see lots of people posting things like \"IT\" and \"supply chain management\" and all sorts of stuff and I'm sitting here reading this going \"wow, I'd kill myself if that was my career path.\"  Just because it's available doesn't mean it's right for you.  Aristotle is quoted as having once said \"where the needs of the world and your interests intersect, there lies your vocation.\"  The advice I always give to teenagers is to first figure out what you're passionate about - either through hobbying or volunteer work or whatever the case may be.  Once you figure it out, ask yourself \"how can I do this for money?\"  From there, talk to people who are already in that career field and figure out the best way to get involved.  When I decided I wanted a career in music, I emailed every record label I could think of (even major ones) and asked \"Hey, I'm interested in working in music, I'm starting college soon, what degree would you recommend as a label that would benefit me as a potential job applicant someday?\" and believe it or not, most of the labels wrote me back (even the big ones) and said \"marketing easily.\"  I'm an audio engineer by trade these days and it blows my mind how many kids are like \"I'm gonna go to Full Sail and get my music business/recording degree!\" and then here come an army of people like me going \"yeah, that's pretty and all, but you're really just blowing thousands of dollars.  There's plenty of reliable, top-notch resources out there that can teach you more for significantly less AND get you a better shot in the industry.\"\n\nTL;DR: Figure out what you love doing, figure out how to make money doing it, then ask people who are already doing that how to follow in their steps.",

I just find it amazing that nobody has pointed out (as far as I saw) that it's really a personal preference thing.  Hopefully somebody does peruse this thread and go \"oh, that's a cool career I never thought of.\"  But unfortunately a lot of people - especially college kids - haven't really been taught how to think independently yet, that's why so many of them go get degrees and jobs that they hate.  The important thing is to find a career you love, and in my experience that starts with going \"what do I love?\"  Threads like these are great for helping to figure that out, but if you don't go in with the right mentality you'll still end up grinding away at a soul-crushing job because it's not the job you really wanted.",

There are jobs that don't require a 4 year degree. I have several friends who went to community college and are now tradesmen such as welders, automotive mechanics, and carpenters. We all graduated high school the same year and we are now in our late twenties and I am amazed how well off they are. One of my friends just started his own automotive repair and body shop and is quite successful; he just bought his first house. One of my friends is a welder making $26ish an hour and is on track to be promoted within his company. He too just bought a house and is very happy with a stout savings. I got a 4-year degree and *on paper* make more money, but am paying student debt. I haven't amassed much of a savings because of this and am still renting when I want to buy. I think it has put me behind them in the rat race. Some here will probably argue that I didn't do the *right* degree, or will have some quip to tell me how I blew it. Maybe I should have done an engineering degree or whatever but I am simply saying don't sleep on trade jobs either. I think learning a trade is a 100% viable start to rewarding career path. ",

You'll probably make under $50k if you have a non technical degree and under $80k I you have a technical degree for your first job.  The most important thing in my opinion is to not get stuck at one job at first.  Try a few things that you are interested in while in your mid 20s (stay for at least 1-2 years at each.) Work hard. Build a network of supporters and people who believe in you.  Once you've found your calling through trial and error, work as hard as you can and make sure you have a level of education that is at least average in your chosen field.  \n\nMost companies don't want to give raises over 3-5% even for good performance - so realize you'll need to change companies 2-3 times (usually for 10% plus raises to justify the risk of leaving) before you're at a level of compensation that you imagined when you went to school.\n\nLife and work aren't easy - but finding a job that you enjoy doing and pays well is not impossible. As every snowflake is different, so is every career path I've seen.  Please be flexible and consider different types of jobs.",

Do you really devalue your time so much as to be paid minimum wage for an hour of your day? figure out what your time is worth, find a way to get that. i'd rather work hard for 5 years and build a business asset that allows me to be financially free than work 40 years and hope there's enough for retirement. \nAllow yourself to dream and continue dreaming. Don't sell yourself to the Employee/Self-Employed thinking, don't trade your time for money. Think in big business and investing, build assets, work for your whole life, work for freedom. \nOnce you get that, think of all the things you could do, people you could help, time you could invest into your family. \nThat's what should be most important.",

It is still on the smaller side but there are so many different paths you can take with a degree in the field of Geographic Information Sciences. Unless the school has a formalized program it is usually wrapped up in either the Geography major or sometimes the Atmospheric/Earth Sciences. \n\nIt is a fantastic career path because internships are usually very easy to come by. Municipalities and other government agencies utilize GIS for planning and mapping and are usually so technology starved that a junior walking in with a year of GIS experience is a godsend to them. If you have an environmental interest, conservation planning is heavily relying on GIS. \n\nThe private market is also looking more towards this field. Insurance for example uses it for spatial analysis, visualization, and the representation of uncertainty. My department has hired 4 people in the past 3 years right out of college just for their GIS technical skills. Elsewhere in our company we've created an entire GIS department for people with a little bit more experience in the field. \n\nIt is an analyst position to start making between $50-$65k depending on where you go and what skills you have. After a few years you can either be overseeing production builds of GIS tools and applications for much more. It is also an area that you can get started with in the military. Our most recent hire came from the Army doing intelligence work using GIS capabilities. Went to the local state university on his GI bill and we had him intern every summer until he graduated (we pay interns ~$18-20/hr for 10 weeks). ",
