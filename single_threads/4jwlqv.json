            "body": "I feel like something that plagues movies these days is the attempt at forcing comedy instead of allowing the  cast to just be funny. Movies like the original Ghostbusters or Beverly Hills Cop didn't really seem like all out comedies to me. But the actors in them made the movies funny over what was an otherwise seriously toned film. \n \nDoes that make sense to anyone else?\n",

Ray is pigging out and when Venkman learns of the finances he just says \"Chew your food\" implying that Ray should enjoy this last meal before going out of business. I guess it is Murray's delivery but that simple, offhand line to me is very funny and epitomizes Ghostbusters' understated comedy.\n\nAnother great example of this is before the final confrontation with Gozer and Venkman condescendingly shouts \"Get her, Ray\" from behind as a callback to Ray's failed plan with the librarian in the beginning of the film. That type of humor is just too subtle for movies these days.",

These scripts are written and rewritten and passed through hundreds of different hands.  So many cooks.  And, you can't pass a script of dry humor past a board and have them understand that it will actually be funny.  And in the modern movie industry design that's critical.  In fact, even sloppy wet obvious jokes are hard to sell to a board like that.  Out of context it just doesn't seem funny, and that makes it a hard sell.  \n\nIt's a shame really.  I bet these actors are actually very funny people, and I have seen them adlib lines and deliver unfunny words in a very funny way.  It's obvious from the trailers they are all trying as hard as they can with what they have been given to work with.

When another character walks in and needs to be caught up, the informed character says to Egon, \"Tell'em about the Twinkie.\" and the scene ends. \n\nIn the original, the jokes didn't stop the pace of the film.

I'm not saying necessarily that there is anything wrong with that (okay, I personally think it's stupid and formulaic), but it is simply conditioning for the audience so they know what is happening, and there is a brief moment of heightened expectation before *POW* they hit you with exactly what you knew was coming.

This is what I mean in my other post about how they have to punctuate their slapstick humor with a quip to remind the audience that this is supposed to be funny.\n\nThinking on it, if they had done the exact same bit of slapstick, and then had Jones groan for a bit before getting up without complaint, it might have actually been amusing. Jackie Chan regularly goes through slapstick moments of pain like this, grimaces, shows he's hurt, then moves on, and it's a hundred times funnier than if he stopped the action to make a joke directed at the audience.",

Then there was just the simple social awkwardness of Rick Moranis' character. It wasn't in your face, obvious, childish comedy like in the new trailer.

                    "body": "Comedies from the 70s and 80s (specifically American-produced films) are drastically different monsters from those seen since. The 90s saw this rise in self-aware, meta-comedy. This rise in almost sitcom-like movies, in which the scenes pause for the reactions of an audience that isn't there. In the worst of these movies, you can almost hear that canned laughter.\n\nNow, this also carries over into the marketing for movies. You see studio execs cut trailers in a fashion that completely redefines the final movie. My wife made a solid observation the other day when she pointed out how the trailer for Bridesmaids made that movie seem like a completely different one than the final film, with humor that felt more punchy and sitcom-y than the more subdued and nuanced humor that we actually saw on screen. This was a clear attempt at attracting audiences who have been conditioned to embrace that sort of overt punchy humor.\n\nThat said, I do wonder if that could be the case with this movie as well. A lot of people here are pointing out the bit where Leslie falls into the crowd and makes her little quip, but none have pointed out that these trailers are cut by completely different people than the final movie. The final scene could play out in a very different manner, possibly with that joke removed, changed, or at least framed or delivered in a less punchy manner.\n\nOf course, it could be left that way entirely. And this is Sony, a studio notorious for interfering heavily in productions. The first two Ghostbuster movies suffered greatly because of this, especially the second. This might even prove to be more a studio exec cut than Feig's.\n\nBut, overall, the trailers do seem to suggest (accurately or not) a more modern style comedy. But that's the time we live in. This is not the 80s and this is very much not the original movie. It's a different beast for a number of reasons. But I do think that people are unfairly comparing this movie to one that was very much a product of its time and place. Different eras, different cast, different types of humor desired by audiences. It might feel very different from the original movie, but I'm more interested in if it can still manage to stand on its own two feet.",

            "body": "Forget the gender thing, the lame jokes thing, and the stereotyping thing. What bothers me most about these trailers is that the filmmakers seem to have forgotten the entire premise of the first *Ghostbusters*. The movie was not about nuclear physicists who battle the paranormal\u2014it was about schlubby exterminators with a dirty job that no one else wanted to do.\n\nThe Ghostbusters had beer bellies and cigarettes dangling from their mouths. They lived in an abandoned firehouse, drank Budweiser, and ate leftover Chinese food. If they weren't wearing jumpsuits, we'd see their ass-cracks. This is a city with piles of hot garbage and rats the size of dogs, and these are the doofuses who wade through the sewers trying to clean it up. The joke in the movie's premise, of course, is that the \"rats\" were poltergeists and other evil spirits.\n\nEven the production design made them look like exterminators. They wore jumpsuits and heavy black rubber gloves. The ghost traps looked just like rat traps and the proton packs looked like those backpack cannister things used to spray for bugs. The Ghostbusters didn't wield fancy glowing pistols and transforming, arm-mounted ecto-cannons or whatever the hell we see in the new trailer\u2014they lugged around radioactive bug spray. The special effects were secondary, and the gadgets looked cobbled together\u2014even Spengler didn't know if the stuff was going to work.\n\nSomehow, the line, \"Back off man. I'm a scientist\" became the calling-card for *Ghostbusters*, but what made that line funny is that Venkman *wasn't* a scientist. He was the complete opposite. He did bullshit research in a fake discipline just so he could get chicks. Does anyone really think that the stuff he was spraying around Dana's apartment had any scientific properties whatsoever? It was probably mail-order cologne designed to \"drive women wild\". Venkman was a charlatan who stumbled into the city's paranormal crisis. He was maybe the *least*-qualified person to tackle it.\n\nThe first time we see the Ghostbusters in their now-iconic outfits, they're striding into the lobby of a swanky hotel to \"quietly\" take care of a ghost infestation. It's as though management found bedbugs in one of the suites and desperately wants to avoid the word getting out. The stark contrast between the hotel's clean, five-star decor and the guys' sloppy plumber's attire is what makes the scene so damn funny.\n\n\"What are you supposed to be, some kind of cosmonaut?\"  \n\"No, we're exterminators. Someone saw a cockroach up on twelve.\"  \n\"That's gotta be some cockroach.\"  \n\"Bite your head off, man.\"\n\n*That's* what the movie was about. But from what I've seen in the trailers, the Ghostbusters identity has been polished, plugged in, sent to grad school, and dry-cleaned. The plot seems to revolve around nuclear physics and futuristic gadgets, but this is *Ghostbusters*, not *Men in Black*. Without the feeling that the main characters are sloppy exterminators who get in way over their heads, the new movie just seems to exist in a different universe.\n\nUgh. This whole thing makes me so mad.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the Reddit Gold, kind stranger!",

Leslie Jones is seriously ruining it.\n\nIf you had all the same stuff but just replaced Leslie Jones with someone actually funny. Say, Aubrey Plaza, I think this movie would look above average, and probably pretty enjoyable for most.\n\nLeslie Jones seriously just brings the whole thing down though. She's not funny. She plays the same role in every last thing she does. She's terrible at acting and literally always acts/sounds/looks identical to her normal self. The jokes written around her are incredibly forced and terrible, and also awkwardly \"political\". She's also awful on SNL for the same reasons.\n\nShe's just 10,000% fucking *terrible*.\n\nAnd it has nothing to do with her being black or a woman. I love plenty of female comics and black comics, and think you can do the \"political\" stuff in a good way when it's not forced and overdone, but god damn is she terrible.\n\nThe other 3 women can definitely hold their own. McCarthy isn't totally my cup of tea but she definitely appeals to certain people and has her moments (although she often ends up feeling pretty same-ole-same-ole and tired too). McKinnon and Wiig are both great though, and look genuinely good in this.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but I think this movie will go down as a failure largely due to Leslie Jones being wildly unfunny and having way too much screen time doing so.",

She keeps taking these roles. It's not like she's forced to, and then I would have to guess that once she's signed on for something people start writing \"her\" style of jokes.\n\nThe falling into the audience bit and \"lady or race\" doesn't even make sense. Why would people not catch you just because you're black or just because you're a woman?\n\nThe typical bit would be to have it be a fat girl - which is how I imagine the script might have initially read. That wouldn't be terribly funny either, but at least it would make sense. Instead now it feels like they forced it because it's \"her\" humor, and it doesn't make any sense.",

I *want* to see more women in films, I *want* to see more racial diversity in lead roles, I just don't want them to be shitty movies, especially if they're shitty movies that call attention to themselves as if they're actually progressive. I'm not a dickhead because this isn't my kind of movie. \n\nYou know it's bs on the filmmakers part because the line doesn't even make sense in context, people got out of the way of Leslie Jones stagediving because she's a huge person diving into a crowd with a goddamn metal backpack. \"Oh shit, this black lady is stagediving, let her fall\" ?? It's so pointed and obvious and out of nowhere, it's nearly breaking the 4th wall for viewers but totally misses.",

My issue is why- in a 2016 movie that is supposed to be empowering women and giving them the smart lead roles- short-changing the only minority, playing into stereotypes, and generally leaving her behind?",

I have LOTS of memories of that movie, the least of which being the opening court scene, \"judicial mistrangement,\" \"doooooo, Ray....EGON,\"  toaster jumping around, piloting the Statue of Liberty with a NES controller, an aggressive bathtub, \"higher and higher,\" \"there is no here...so why are you came,\" and hey, Weaver in a bra.\n\nIt was a worthy sequel, even if not as good as the original.  Temple of Doom wasn't as good as Raiders, but it was still a worthy sequel and installment in the franchise.  \n\nThis reboot seems like nothing of the sort.  \n\nEdited some wording.",

I saw both trailers now and this is now officially a remake of the original movie, or isn't it? Almost all the things I saw were either ripped or heavily based off of  the original movie. Slimer scene? Check. Puke scene? Check. Ghostbusters talking to a mayor or something along the lines? Check. Stay Puft? Check. Snobby guy employing the Ghostbusters? Check. The only thing that is legitimately new and kinda fun is the idea of a ghost that looks like some heavy metal mascot on a concert. Tbh none of the jokes really landed for me. Anyways, I hope critics won't lose themselves in some fake SJW hate or support when it comes down to the quality of the movie. ",

Now, with paranormal activity at an all-time low, the people of NYC have mostly forgotten about the supernatural threats from the 80s, and the Ghostbusters have hung up their Proton Packs and retired. Due to the \u201cphantasmically historic\u201d nature of the building and also because of the inherent \u201cresidual spectral energy\u201d, a group of four female parapsychologists have rented out the original Ghostbusters HQ in order to pursue their academic studies and experiments. Unbeknownst to them and the people of New York, a new supernatural threat has arisen and set in motion a plan to destroy the city. As the rate of paranormal incidents in the city rises and the evil intentions of this new supernatural villain begin to take shape, the young scientists decide to take up the mantle of the Ghostbusters and embark on a campaign to defeat this new threat and save the city once again.     \n\n",

Pulp Fiction's only punchline in the dialogue is when Mia purposefully tells a joke. \n\nThis trailer, in contrast, is full of punchlines. Nothing funny can happen without there being a punchline. It's the cinematic equivalent of a laugh track, and it bugs the crap out of me. I don't need a cue to laugh, I'll just laugh if something is funny. I've noticed this same pattern in a lot of comedies, especially those really bad satire flicks. I think that, more so than the too colorful CGI, rubs me the wrong way.",

I hope you all join me in refusing to spend money on this or any other attempt at dishonest publicizing.\n\nThese people won't stop making false accusations until we stop giving them our money. ",

            "body": "> I like to compare it to lets say Back to the Future. Thats a movie that is very beloved and very much enjoyable still to this day. However if they announced that they were going to completely remake Back to the Future I would be pissed. No need for it. All those who love it still watch it and show it to people who haven't seen it. It would be %100 a cash grab. Then if they announced not only are we remaking it but we are going to make the main two character female. I would then feel like they are trying to use feminism as a marketing tool. Do I believe that a female lead can't be good? absolutely not. But I don't think any other actors can replace Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Making them female just adds fuel to the fire. They are basically saying we want to remake a movie for money and use female leads but we want you to roll over and accept it or else you are sexist.\nThis is how I feel about Ghost Busters",

Favorite movie of all time, no questions asked. Didn't care about the casting choices. All female? Whatever, who cares. Reboot? Ehhh... interest waning. Reboot with the same logo, same name, and \"30 years later\" shtick to attempt to appeal to '84 fans from the first trailer? Okay, now I'm annoyed.\n\nNow, this trailer comes out -- and, honestly? What the fuck?! If it's a reboot, don't use **the same plot devices the first two did**. Don't use **the same fucking firestation**. Don't **replicate both movies scene for fucking scene**.\n\nFuck this movie. ",

It's reverse comedy.  Nonmedy.\n\nNobody caught her, okay.  This could have been due to any number of reasons (aside from the fact that people falling down is funny).  But suddenly it has to be because the awful, wicked people who didn't catch her CHOSE not to catch her because they don't like her race or gender.  \"Catch me or you're a racist/sexist!\"  \n\nNow instead of a pleasant chuckle because the character fell down, or a funny line about how the thing she's wearing on her back is an unstable nuclear device, or ANY joke at all... everyone suddenly gets to feel awkward about the character being the supposed victim of sexism/racism.

This film **was** going to be hated on for rebooting a classic \"male\" franchise with a primarily female cast. A good amount of the vitriol being directed at the film **is** for unsavory reasons.\n\nAt the same time, this still looks really, really bad. Best case scenario appears to be that it's soulless and mediocre, and that's a pretty crap \"best case scenario\" to be stuck rooting for. I suppose there's always that Hail Mary hope that the trailers are wildly misleading and it's a secret gem. I like Wiig. I like Feig. I like McCarthy. These people are not incompetent. I just can't recall a single moment from either trailer where I even...chuckled. Snorfled. Breathed out loudly through my nose. I do recall several moments where I cringed. And at least one moment where I said \"oh no\" audibly. That's bad!\n\nMind you I was always against the idea of rebooting Ghostbusters. Not because \"my childhood!\" or because I think all male casts are sacrosanct...quite the opposite. I was against rebooting Ghostbusters because we already had a second go-round at Ghostbusters. It had an all-star cast of comedy legends in it, most of them at the peak of their careers, and it was hot garbage with barely a single redeeming element. \"Ghostbusting\" is not a bullet proof concept. The original movie was a happy accident that has cemented itself in popular culture as an iconic film, and I don't think you're going to get any further remaking it then you would trying to reboot Back to the Future or The Breakfast Club.\n\nI just wish they'd cast Adam Sandler and Co. for this, and we could all feel good about calling it out for looking so shitty. Even Adam would be in there with us, taking shots at the try-hard jokes and feeble callbacks. Instead it's got a front row seat in an online culture war, despite showing every indication of being a woefully mishandled piece of cinematic detritus. ",

It finds a nice middle ground and has something for both of us, and can offer up for her an action flick where girls are kicking ass.  To the adult audience, they might find it repulsive, but to a 9 year old girl who has not been jaded by reprocessed crap and cliche, it should be very inspiring.  ",

This man has no dick.\")  there was a creepy moment with Dana (Being held down by monster hands in her chair and being shoved into a closet with a demonic beast.). \n\nWith the Ghostbuster remake's first trailer we didn't get any of that balance. With this new trailer, we finally get it. It's creepy, it's spooky, it's funny, it has so much potential. Especially with what looks like Hemsworth playing a supernatural villain. \n\nNow I want to see this. ",

If or when I have a daughter the movies I'll be holding up as standard bearers for strong female characters in cinema are the likes of Alien, Silence of the Lambs or even the fucking Hunger Games and not this exploitative mess.",

I liked the window ghost thing and it seems in line with the original movies. Barf joke was stupid but I thought it was bad in the original as well.\n\n**0:41 - 1:00** And now we start to see the problems. *What do we think of these Ghostbusters* was way too on-the-nose. And of course the clich\u00e9 joke about the fat person who can't crowd surf, then pulling up both the race and gender card. Ugh. At least the remixed song is kinda cool?\n\n**1:00 - 1:25** Surprisingly little giveaway on the plot. Just a quick sentence and that's it. Probably could have left out the secretary getting possessed though.\n\n**1:26 - 1:39** Ok so more plot... secretary is evil. Generic world ending scenario that was tired even in the original.\n\n**1:40 - 1:44** Didn't laugh. Getting kinda tired of that joke formula. You say you won't do a thing, then do it? Har.\n\n**1:45 - 2:04** Yep, that's the comedy they're going for. Not my style but it doesn't make me cringe like the end of the first trailer.\n\n**2:05 - 2:08** Of course we need the marshmallow man. Because it was in the first one. Why come up with something original?\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Surprisingly, I didn't hate it. It was uninspired and clich\u00e9, but the visuals actually look pretty cool. Didn't laugh at any of the jokes, but one joke from the first trailer got me. I guess if I were to sum up my thoughts in one word, it'd be *indifferent*.\n\nPeople are so ready to hate this movie, to enjoy it crash and burn. Honestly I just don't care one way or the other.",

So, if the rumors are true that Bill Murray is in the movie, then show him and make him look like he is a focal point of the movie, bait and switch. And if the movie is actually good, get credits in there to watch the movie. Hope for great reviews, maybe do some early releases to build word of mouth...if the movie is good. Otherwise, take the loss and use the movie to hide earnings from other movies. ",

I felt it was a huge missed opportunity to build on the events that have occurred since the last 2 movies. I wasn't excited, but planned on seeing it, since I loved the original, and liked the new cast. It couldn't be as bad as GB2 (I really hated that one)\n\nThen I saw the 1st trailer, some of the back and forth between the creators of this movie, and the public online, and then the 2nd trailer.\n\nNow, I am not as eager. Between the reboot rehashing too much of the original plot points, and the gender politics that have been tossed around as reasons / excuses that didn't need to be a thing, I'm totally turned off by the whole idea, now. I'll probably wait for video / Netflix at this point.",

Second trailer (international trailer) \"yeah, okay, this doesn't look as bad as I first thought\". This trailer \"actually yeah this looks alright\".  \nI don't think it's going to blow anyone's socks off, but it looks like a perfectly fine movie.\n\nEdit: wow, some of you clearly do NOT like people having their own opinion.",

Perhaps if I had seen this one first I would have been more open to it but I still issues within the trailer.\n\nFirst off stop showing us the firehouse. The movie doesn't take place there, this isn't a continuation for the originals, let's just break those ties. We get it, at the end of the movie they'll move into the firehouse and fans of the original are supposed to get super excited. Just stop already.\n\nSecondly it seems like the leaked script is pretty much confirmed as legit now as there's enough in this movie to see that's the story they went with. So even without already knowing how this plays out the story is very uninspired and not really that good.\n\nThirdly the humor still just doesn't connect with me. All of it feels way too on the nose and self aware, I feel like the characters should look into the camera with that \"Am I right ladies and gentlemen?\" look on their face. It still feels like this belongs in a spoof movie like Scary Movie and not an actual Ghostbusters movie.\n\nAnd lastly they keep trying to use nostalgia to lure people into this movie. From using the original theme, showing the original location, and so many other familiar beats including the giant monster at the end we're supposed to think is the Stay Puft Marshmallowman but in reality is the Ghostbusters logo come to life.\n\nI'll be very surprised if this comes out and is even halfway decent.

I'll say that I do like the music and so far the CGI doesn't seem bad. However the main issue I take with the CGI is it feels like they were going more for modern horror than \"Ghostbusters\". That said the dialogue is just absolutely extremely cringe and further reinforces the negative viewpoint that the decisions that led up to this movie were nothing more than a social justice agenda. \n\nThat said, I'm at least willing to watch it when it hits redbox now. I still expect it to be horrible, but it is worth $2 to find out first hand. I would not at all go to a theater or buy it outright at this point though. I'm still 99% certain that it is just going to be a social justice agenda pushing cringefest that shits all over what ghostbusters was.",
